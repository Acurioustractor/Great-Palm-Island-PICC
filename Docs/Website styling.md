# PICC Website Styling and Brand Guide

Creating a visual identity for the Palm Island Community Company website requires thoughtful consideration of the island's cultural heritage, historical journey, and contemporary aspirations. The following styling recommendations aim to honor both the Manbarra and Bwgcolman peoples while creating a modern, accessible, and engaging digital presence.

## Color Palette

The color palette draws inspiration from the natural environment of Palm Island and carries cultural significance:

### Primary Colors:
- **Deep Ocean Blue (#19466C)** - Representing the surrounding waters of Palm Island, connection to sea country, and PICC's established identity
- **Island Green (#227D51)** - Symbolizing the lush vegetation of the island and growth toward self-determination
- **Earth Red (#983D2A)** - Honoring the land connection and cultural resilience

### Secondary Colors:
- **Sand (#E6D2B5)** - Representing the island's beaches and providing a warm neutral background
- **Sunrise Yellow (#F5B042)** - Symbolizing new beginnings and optimism
- **Sky Blue (#8BBBD9)** - Representing openness and possibility

### Accent Colors:
- **Mangrove Black (#242424)** - For text and details, representing strength and grounding
- **Shell White (#F8F5F0)** - For backgrounds and negative space

The palette creates a balance between sea and land elements, reflecting the island's environment while avoiding stereotypical "Aboriginal art" colors that might feel inauthentic or generic.

## Typography

### Headings: 
**Montserrat Bold** - A strong, contemporary sans-serif that conveys authority and clarity. Its geometric structure suggests forward-thinking leadership while remaining accessible.

### Body Text: 
**Source Sans Pro** - A highly readable font designed specifically for digital interfaces. Its larger x-height ensures readability even at smaller sizes, making content accessible to all community members.

### Cultural Quotes or Special Text: 
**Bitter** - A slab serif that provides distinction for elder quotes, historical references, or cultural terms. It carries a sense of permanence and respect.

All fonts should be used in a hierarchy that creates clear content organization, with generous spacing to improve readability.

## Visual Elements

### Patterns and Motifs
Rather than using generic Indigenous motifs, work with local Palm Island artists to develop:

1. **Wave Patterns** - Representing both the surrounding sea and the continuous journey of the community
2. **Island Silhouettes** - Simplified outlines of Palm Island that can serve as section dividers or background elements
3. **Connection Points** - Visual representations of community relationships and "many tribes, one people"

These elements should be used subtly and consistently, never overshadowing the content.

### Photography Guidelines
- Prioritize authentic images of Palm Island landscapes, community events, and PICC activities
- Ensure proper permissions from community members before using their images
- Use warm, natural lighting that highlights the vibrancy of community life
- Include images that show both traditional cultural practices and contemporary community achievements
- Consider having dedicated photo sessions that capture the essence of each PICC service area

### Iconography
Develop a custom icon set that relates specifically to PICC services and Palm Island contexts, avoiding generic icons where possible. Icons should be:
- Simple and clearly readable
- Consistent in style (line weight, corner treatment)
- Culturally appropriate and relevant to the community

## Layout Principles

The website layout should embody the following principles:

### Community-Centered Design
- Clear pathways to information that matters most to community members
- Prominent featuring of community voices through quotes and stories
- Space for community announcements and updates

### Respectful Presentation of History
- Chronological organization of historical content
- Context provided for sensitive historical events
- Elder perspectives featured prominently

### Balance of Traditional and Contemporary
- Modern, clean interface that doesn't feel corporate or impersonal
- Integration of cultural elements in a thoughtful, non-tokenistic way
- Celebration of both traditional knowledge and contemporary achievements

## Design System Components

Create a consistent design system with the following components:

1. **Story Cards** - Distinctive styling for Manbarra and Bwgcolman stories using the respective cultural colors (Ocean Blue for Bwgcolman, Earth Red for Manbarra)

2. **Timeline Elements** - Visual components that represent Palm Island's journey from colonial control to self-determination

3. **Service Modules** - Consistent styling for each PICC service area with appropriate iconography

4. **Navigation** - Intuitive navigation that respects both traditional hierarchies and modern usability expectations

5. **Acknowledgment Space** - A consistent visual treatment for Acknowledgments of Country and cultural protocols

## Implementation Recommendations

When implementing this visual identity:

1. **Begin with an Elder consultation** to ensure the approach resonates with community values

2. **Create a pattern library** of approved visual elements that can be consistently applied

3. **Develop mobile-first designs** acknowledging that many community members may access the site via smartphones

4. **Ensure accessibility** with appropriate contrast, text sizing, and alternative text

5. **Create a visual style guide** that can be shared with future designers to maintain consistency

The overall styling should convey the message of "community-controlled excellence" - professional and modern, but distinctly of and by the Palm Island community. This visual identity should support PICC's journey from "government initiative to community control" by creating a digital presence that truly belongs to the Palm Island community.
