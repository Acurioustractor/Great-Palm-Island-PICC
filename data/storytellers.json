And how long you been in Palm Island? 49 years. What do you reckon of it? Ah, it's bit of changes. It changes a better, but yeah. Sorry, just for a young Cuba. Yeah. How's how do you reckon that the island's going in general?\nWhat do you think? A bit ups and downs, between the, society itself. Yeah. So we're having a bit of a problem here. Even with the council. Yeah. What about the bedding situation? What do you think the beds are like around here? Oh man, they're fit for me. Honestly, it's good.\nYes. Yeah, and I appreciate when I use it the first night, yeah. Tell me what it felt like to sleep on it. Ah, nice and comfortable. But it's just that my dogs rip my cushion off them. And I'm done. And you were telling me about washing it before. How do you wash the mattress? Oh, I just hand wash. And why do you hand wash?\nWhat's that about? I just love it. [00:01:00] I'm a silly lad. Tell us what do you reckon other people should get in this mattress and why? For one, it's good for when you need outdoor spaces. It's good for outdoor. Oh, even like you said, you can Make it into a bed. You can even turn it into a table. Even like you said, so I've done it myself.\nYeah, and it works. Comes from an Aboriginal person, it works. Yeah. Yeah, that's super interesting. Why do you think it works from an Aboriginal perspective? What's that, what, why, can you explain a bit more? Oh for me, I no longer like to just lay around anywhere and lay around anyhow. So for me, I can just take it here and there.\nJust to get out and walk about. Even just going down a little bit. Down the corner, of my yard, just laying down in there. What would your message be to other communities about the beds? If they were thinking about using them, but not sure, what would you say to other people about trying it out?\nTry it. Try it. You won't regret it, I tell you. You won't regret it, trust me. If I can do it, you can. And how do you reckon, so we've got to [00:02:00] make 100 beds this weekend, how do you think we best Work with the community and support the families and stuff doing it. What's our best way to do that? Mate, like you got it here.\nIt's just for you like, you can also Like maybe put something up like a, to a little business note to let people know when you're coming over and when you're going So, you'll have more people ready for you the next time you come over You see, like me, I was looking for you straight away when I saw you.\nI just came straight back. It was pretty exciting when we came and you just set it up straight away. And I remember, I think you saw Nick at the barge. Do you remember what you said to him? Yeah, we were supposed to have this interview, yeah. But I couldn't go out, I didn't catch you. You were supposed to be at the the ranger's station.\nBut you weren't there. Do you remember what you said to Nick? Nah, he just asked me if we can go like this. How did you like that? What you call, we came and saw you, but you went down. I said, oh, you, sorry. But what did you say to him when he when he said, do you do [00:03:00] like it? I said him, I was good.\nYeah. And then he said, will just come see you and so you can, gimme a better point of view and have a little recording. So like this, but I couldn't find you. And what do you think we should do in the future with the beds? Like how, what do you, what would you like to see in the future for the beds?\nI don't know, probably pee with my blanket. Bigger or smaller. Yeah. But I prefer smaller. Yeah. Single size bed, yeah. Okay, cool. And there's one more little message about the beds. What would you say to someone who was not sure about it? One last time. If they were not sure about getting a bed, what would you say to them?\nOh, I would say, yeah, get it. For sure, brother, yeah. If people have ideas like this, usually wouldn't have been here any, but doing this, That's a good idea. I reckon many people should be able to do it. Just try it. Please, just try it. You won't get it. Hehe.\nI get it wrong."

Tell us where you're from, a little bit about yourself. I grew up here on Palm, back and forward, come over for the footy, Christmas. Grew up yeah, grew up back and forward from here in Townsville and down in Brisbane at the moment.\nCome back for Christmas, come up, play some footy, meet up with the boys, that's about it. Where are you from and where do you stay? Northside, in Everton Park. Yeah, Annalie Pick leaves up the coast and Yeah, I'm not too familiar with the spots, yeah. Yeah, me either. Yeah, that's [00:01:00] it.\nTell us, what do you know about Palm in terms of Beds and washers and fridges and stuff? Oh, it's the biggest muck around, to get them over. You have to bring them on the barge if you can't bring them on, you can't just take them on the boat and you have to pay for freight and stuff.\nYou can't just go down to the store and buy beds and stuff, it's hard for families and, especially over here, you won't just have a family, one family in one house. You'll have multiple families, in the one house and not everyone gets a bed, and not everyone has that place to stay.\nPapa! Yeah? There! Yeah, bed. Bed. Yeah. Thought of grabbing you? I think he's putting down that grass over there. Oh, go. Go away. Come here, baby. Yeah and Yeah, that was a really good grab there. What's do people come down to shop here, or do they get on the barge? Yeah, I think it's just sending it over.\nEveryone just comes over on the barge. I think even if you want to get bigger queen size and king size, I think they have to bring them [00:02:00] from Lucinda. And I think they have to drive to England to do that. And we have to go from Townsville, then drive up to England, then come across. It is a big mark around for beds, yeah.\nAnd what do Are you not having a bed, or having a bad bed, do you reckon? Are there knock on effects? Oh, you're gonna have a bad back, yeah, it's And having a bed is something like, you need, you can't, you feel more safe when you sleep in a bed. It's different than sleeping on the couch, and then sleeping on the ground, most people do be doing that, sleeping on couches and stuff, don't have beds. And yeah, I reckon it is better to like, get more rest, and It's, yeah, it's just better. Huh, beds. And how were you rocked up and made a bed together? What was it like making it? Oh, easy. Nice, quick and easy. That's it. If I, zip ties all you need, zip them together, chuck the sheet on, you go to sleep.\nAnd you were sitting on there to lie down, what do you reckon of that comfort and that stuff? After I go for a swim, I'm going to sleep. [00:03:00] Nice and comfy, yeah. Toppers are good. You got little protectors underneath them and everything. You said easy to wash, hey? Easy. It's all you need easy to put together, easy to maintain.\nSo we're going, we've been at Kalgoorlie, Tennant, Mount Isa and stuff. What do you reckon we need to do to make sure these beds work in community for those places? Are there things that we should do to help listen or change or stuff like that? I just think not being shame, because a lot of new people, when they go to new places, they have that shame to go and ask people and sit down and talk, I just think that's one thing is you got to get that shameless out of the way and go and ask, sit down and talk to them. These boys have been doing it, you're telling me stories and that, which is good, you got to, you really got to know the family, and have that inside look of it, and that's the only way you will know if you go and approach them and ask them because they're not going to come to you. They're the same, they'll feed the same, shame to go up and ask. That's so interesting, that's one of the reflections I've been thinking about is we're going around and offering these to people and we're getting really good feedback but, like how do we make sure [00:04:00] that shame factor is not there when they see these things are not working?\nSo yeah, opening that space up. Yeah and most important question, are you gonna, you got another game today? Nah, not today, tomorrow. Tomorrow, and you're gonna win? Yeah, hopefully get a win. Are you playing? Not too sure yet. And tell us a bit about Christmas Cup while I'm here, what is it?\nIt's just a footy thing where all the communities come together. We all come play a game of footy at the end of the year and, a couple of communities come, and Cherbourg and Yarrabaugh were meant to come. And they bring the women's sides and stuff too, so everyone has a go. Yeah.\nThat's cool, bruv. Just stay there for me for one sec. I just gotta see if I can take a photo of you on the bed here. Yeah, look at me though.\nNah! Legend. Thanks bro."

        "Daniel Patrick Noble\n[00:00:00] I did buy a Yarraba team. Yeah! Oh, sure, man. Oh, Yarraba. Sure, man. It was the Yulu, the yellow one. Oh, gotcha. Yeah, because we're from Yarraba. Oh, cool. Yeah, my auntie\nshe's got children to my uncle down here. Yeah. Yeah, so she's been here since high school days. Yeah, yeah. And sorry, just say your full name and spell it, first up. Hello, my name is Daniel Patrick Noble. Hello. D A N I E L P A T R I C K N O B L E. Cool. So you can just look at May, you don't have to worry about this thing.\nYeah, tell us, you just started telling me about yourself anyway, but tell us a bit about yourself. Yeah, I'm just on the island visiting yeah, visiting my auntie from Cairns on holidays. I like to come here often. And yeah, just see family again, all my extended family here on the island. Cool.\nAnd yeah, just enjoy company. And especially seafood as well on the [00:01:00] outer reefs here. Especially the spider shells. That we don't get in Yarraba, where I'm from. Palm Island always feels like home. Because I lived here. I did year five here. I've got a big extended family here. Yeah, every time I'm back visiting.\nI know a lot of people, and a lot of people know me, so it's always like home. That's why I like coming back. Nick and I are trying to work out how to make better goods. Things that are breaking a lot in the community. What are some of the issues you think, Nick? Some of these bedding and washing machines and these type of things in Palm Island.\nWhat are some of the difficulties people have? The difficulties here, compared to where I'm from in Yarraba, we're on the mainland. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Palm Island is surrounded by sea, so their major obstacle is getting it across the ocean to their homelands, into their homes. And that all builds up, the cost of, not only purchasing [00:02:00] it, the cost of having it freighted over as well, it all adds up.\nAnd that's why a lot of, I think that's a big obstacle for the islanders here. When it comes to furnishing their homes. Because it's too hard. Because as with a lot of communities here across North Queensland. A lot of them are low income earners. And just to have that extra cost of bringing it over.\nIt all adds up. And sometimes people would rather just go without. Because they, they wouldn't want to. Be left hanging short on funds. And we've noticed a lot of things breaking over here too. Do you reckon that's like a Is it the goods aren't fit the purpose? Are they just cheap ones? Again with all the costs of freighting, they would rather get something cheaper to cover freighting costs as [00:03:00] well rather than getting something expensive and then Because it all adds up.\nSo why not just get something, say, a 150 bed that would only last maybe a year or two compared to a 500 bed plus freight. That, you're looking at nearly 1, 000 to get that over. It all adds up, so why not stick to the cheaper options, and it doesn't last a lifetime compared to the dearer ones.\nIf that makes sense. So yeah, we've been going for a little bit now. We've tested this stuff out, Calgolian.\nWhat do you think of the general concept, of being out?\nAh for my auntie, she has a lot of visitors. Especially from her hometown in Yarraba. [00:04:00] And sometimes she has to you know, move family around. I'm actually sleeping in my cousin's room, on her bed. who had to move to my uncle's house in order to cater to my needs. So this all comes in handy for when we have family over, especially my auntie.\nAnd so it'll be it's a, it's, I reckon it's a great idea and how it compacts, packs away. And I noticed earlier one of your colleagues there, he was packing it up into a box type Structure Which could actually act as a coffee table in your lounge room when families come over need a place to sleep Dismantle the coffee table and here we go.\nWe have a bed And yeah, you're sitting on it now there's a bunch of different levels of comfort and stuff, but what do you think of the general sort of comfort? I like [00:05:00] firm beds. This is a bit too firm for me. I would definitely go up another layer of cushioning, that's for sure.\nBut, yeah, it's long enough. I'm quite tall. Yeah, this would cater to my needs for sure. We're, yeah, we're doing a lot of doing a learning around cultural protocols and principles and community and stuff. How important do you think that is for us to understand local context and community context?\nOh it's a big one, especially if you haven't been in an indigenous community as anywhere you ask for permission to enter someone's yard or their house. Okay. It's not wise to be in community when we're having sorry business, when someone's passed, especially on the day of the funeral.\nBecause yeah, no one would have time for you because we're all too busy grieving and needing to be elsewhere. But yeah, and it all comes down to common sense and [00:06:00] respect. Yeah. What's the future of goods do you think? What should we do next in terms of like, how do we keep this going I guess?\nIn communities and products and stuff like, or any advice? Say we went to Yarrabah, what Oh, I reckon you should give this a go in Yarraba. See what people think. Because again, we don't have any accommodation there. We don't have any, guest houses. These would be a perfect idea. Because we're all beachside as well, so this could be taken down the beach and used as a seat on the beachside for the day or, again, another bed.\nYeah, it's a great place. Idea and a great concept that could be really versatile in all ways. So cool. Anything else you want to say? Nah, I was glad that you pulled up here because [00:07:00] yeah, we needed more places to sleep. I might have to tell my cousin that she can come back home now because I've got another bed.\nYeah, but yeah, thanks for your time. Thank you, Raz."

Tell me a bit about Palm Island first. I want to know a little bit about what you think of Palm Island. Oh, Palm Island is a beautiful place. It's like a four and a half thousand people, population.\nWe have a service provider that flies in and out. It's a place where you can, come and go. Even though if we go away on a trip, we always come back to the farm. It's always armed to us. Yeah. Tell me a little bit about the situation in some of the homes, like with bedding and white goods and things.\nIs there problems with that stuff? Because when you go mainland, like, when people, family members, or like for beds, and queen [00:01:00] size bed, single beds, yeah. And it's hard for for on the freight, come on the Lucinda barge. Yeah. It's too dear. Too dear. What about like washing machines and fridges and stuff too?\nIs that what you're saying? It's the same thing. Yeah, same thing. Anyone, get some money, they'll go out to town and buy a new washing machine, fridge. Like any white goods, furniture, bed, lounge, dining suite. Everybody goes to Townsville. Like one of the shops. Good guys, Harvey Norman.\nHey, man. But the fright is very, it's very dear. Very dear. And what about, why do you think a good night's sleep is important? Why do you reckon we need a good night's sleep? Ah. We do need rest. Yes. We do. We do. It's for our health. Maintaining health and being.\nAnd we like to, we don't, we can't afford it. Like new mattress. [00:02:00] Yeah. And beds. It's hard. And because of the cost of living for a couple of years. Yeah. That's very hard for locally on Palm Island. Just looking at them, I think they'd be good. We can just take that when we go camping. But they, these collapsed beds, be good when you get Christmas holidays, school holidays, when family coming from the mainland.\nPull it out. There's something there. And kids, they always, Sleep out with family or have to have their friends. Sometimes family don't have extra mattresses. And things like this. Yeah. It's really good. And we're getting it for you guys. It saves us money, but people appreciate things like this.\nI think it's a good thing to especially like Christmas coming up and just spend family. Yeah. Be good. Like we always got a [00:03:00] extra, yeah, a bed and a mattress. Yeah. One of the things too is we're making them so they're like you can pack them up so we wash them. Do you think that's a good idea that you can wash, because it's really hard to wash a mattress, right?\nYeah. Oh, easy. It's pretty easy to keep clean. You can wash it. Wash it out, pack it up. Then the next time you have family come over for celebration, or an event on Palm Island, it's an easy thing just to pull out. Then when they go, pack it up. Yeah. It's awesome. Awesome. And yeah, maybe we'll get you to lie down on one too so we can see if you think you're comfortable.\nNo, Lizzie can lie down on one if she can tell us. Lizzie can't do that. Yeah. The granddaughter. Can we get you to be a comfort check? Yeah. Lay it out for us and tell us how comfortable it is, eh? Yeah. Alright, we'll do round two."

Their discussion of beds as both practical necessities and cultural artifacts (for gathering family) illustrates how Empathy Ledger can document the intersection of material needs and cultural practices while maintaining dignity. Their narrative highlights how seemingly simple interventions (collapsible beds) can honor cultural practices while addressing practical challenges."

        "song finishes you know william goes oh rich he says did you get the email i said what email he says oh i just got cc'd and i said yeah something to see yeah i said oh okay so what does it say so i walk into my office i look at it and i went to the look and he goes oh yeah there's fifty thousand dollars that that that is that and he goes i said you're right now he said yeah i think i gave a walk that's hilarious yeah all right this is rad bros yeah i remember we got a good spot here oh got a little bit of backlight i just realized that i haven't got the right hat on oh true did you bring it oh i don't know i never wear this hat oh there you go boom didn't feel like rich well i hate feeling american anyway sorry anyway mate you said i'm a different rock oh which one i thought it was me i was like what's going on here am i saying something all right bruzzle i reckon we're good look at me for a sec over here my hand there yes let's do that okay i don't know if this is gonna work because it's the end of the day that's cool mate we can do whatever um and i'm gonna feed off your cool inside cool sweet i'm pretty tired too but that drink was good yeah gave me a bit of a bit of a bit of go that's good yeah um why don't you know what's always good let's start with like how you're feeling i guess at the moment yeah that's always a good way to start yeah it can be informal for the first bit might not even use it but how are you feeling yeah oh gosh yeah look um yeah good because it's interesting work you know having max come come along and just pop his head in on one matter and we have not only resolved um what he needed in terms of schooling and that engagement but we have this thing called when we're having conversations with people what's the deep need you know actually you have your need which is the uh the immediate need but what's the what's the deep you need the longing and always i have a conversation um max kept hanging out and we finished the day and i could see this thing where there's this longing And he had this deep need to get back on country. And so, and we worked out that his family had been here twice or whatever. And then he says this throwaway, he says, oh, and I picked it up. He says, oh, yeah, it'd be good to do something in that range of space. I said, I'll be very careful of what you say till I tell that, because I've heard that. And I'm like, yeah. And so, yeah, we'll do this loop where, because I actually said to him, I said, oh, I've got a very specific need for our training education center, which I have been bang on forever and a day. And it's the space between curriculum development between the school and the university and how do we transition that. And I told him about this program that we did in Ipswich. And I needed someone who was good with curriculum who could translate the needs, social needs of disengaged young people in community and to give them a pathway, but also to help teachers then find a path, help them to transition. And part of that transition was better English skills, better math skills, but to get into the space where they're ticking the boxes for the certain different subjects for those choices. And it's not only about stepping stones and a pathway for the students, but stepping stones and pathways for the teachers so that everything had synergy, because the employers, the teachers needed to know that outcome on a certain topic. It was just brilliant. You know, and Cass Grant, I remember talking about this girl, Crass Grant, and she was the one that was able to stitch it together. So I didn't have those skills. And I said, now I'm talking to James Cook University about this training education space. And I haven't got those skills. So I need someone, you know, to connect the space. So he had a deep connection, deep need for his connection to Palm. And I had this deep need for that particular role. Yeah. So, so one of the things is that, you know, I said the same thing back to Nick, you know, this messiness of a website design. And he goes, oh, you know, Ben can help with that one. And I said, oh, be careful what you say. I'm sorry. And then I just said to Nick later, I said, as it is, we had dollars assigned, one for website development, for PR, but also, I kid you not, for drone support. I kid you not, seriously. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. And he went, yeah, absolutely. So even country knows my deep need before even bloody knowing. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So one thing that I do say, how do you feel? Yep. Before we keep going, I'm just going to move this a little bit, just because, look. How are you feeling? Just before you dig into that. Oh, this is awesome, Rich. Yeah. Good spot. Okay, Bryce. Yeah. I'm feeling affirmed, because those principles of country shall provide has come to fruition, even though it's only Wednesday. I was just going, wow, tick, tick, tick, boom. And the other one is, in terms of country survive, is that, you know, I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. I think it's a good thing. Yeah. And I think it's a good thing. And now it's just gone. Country shall provide. But yeah, it is about identifying beyond everything else, you know, what is, yeah. Not to have that bandage solution, but what is that dignity, what is that dignity? That's cool, Bryce. Probably a whole lot. Yeah. Yeah. firm's much trajectory of the training education center building people's capacity that's the real people yeah how um like since since i've got here last three days um like it's been super interesting to me just to see over 10 years i don't know how much visibly has changed on palm island like there's been new buildings and stuff like that um but um i see those young fellas working for you it was interesting for me like coming here so many times not being able to do ceremony not being able to be welcomed correctly that kind of stuff um maybe we can sort of start there and think about like from from what we did this morning how does that sort of relate to like having a place to welcome people and also building for the future maybe like how does that how does that idea around having people like us come partner and try to um build stuff together and everything linking that with ceremony and story and song yeah um so um walter palm island the second um would say to me i remember saying to and he's our senior um law man said um oh man what's this all about what's what's what is this all about um and we're talking this in the context of the resource management plan everything that we're doing how around complex ideas about vision and where we wanted to go the mumbran on the move document and um he summed it up in one word acknowledgement you know and so he just he just wanted our people to be acknowledged as the rightful custodians of this land that's known as palm island you know yeah and we ended playing justанные i don't know if that was told that time but that's when we were asked to arrive and like so he said i think that there was a couple pieces to that um story and so i was never bothered to fees um to örde i didn't feel um just sometimes yeah i don't know how much theawl um um is was um sort of more of like a quote-with-word thing um and yeah and and and that that was no guess um Australian or by the international called FPIC, free and prior informed consent. And yeah, I guess we doubled down on different organisations to say don't bring your programs, we've set the table and we've set a place for you to sit at. You're invited to the table, but it's going to be also on our invitation. And so that's been really interesting. And some people have responded and respectfully said, oh, okay. And some people have continued to do the same thing of not acknowledging and ignoring protocol and coming on country without prior consent. Yeah. And that's been a concern and trading on that basis. So, yeah, we recognise that there's still a battle to be won. But Walter Palm Island would also say beyond the principle of acknowledgement, he would say, is that a principle of? Principles before personalities. Meaning, you know, people will come and say and be, you know, puff their chest out about what they can do and can't do and whatever and promise you the will. But we've got to adhere to our principles. And if we adhere to the principles, then we're going to be able to do what we want. And when he says the principle to, you know, it's principles embedded in law and enshrined within the country. One of those key ones has been that for every newcomer that comes, let's be respectful and do that welcome to country. But we invite people into the story. And we've been able to. Yeah, it was remiss of me to have Nick not taken Nick up the mountain, not taken you up the mountain, to not have done the story to welcome. And so and then. To be able to afford that to Max, he was so pumped and just blown away. Oh, wow. This this is really cool. So to have those younger men. Now become comfortable for Uncle Al to be comfortable with speaking language and to do that language well for young water to stand tall and do that presentation, not only in the ceremony, but also in the school. Yeah, it just warms my heart that these young men and my elders are finding their rightful place again. So that's a beautiful thing. So like all I see at the moment, especially the last few days is talk around building, but I also hear it place. Yeah. That's the one thing of still learning. But understanding the need for having something that is built in this place that provides capacity and builds for the future. What's like the maybe if you start with the like the end game as to what what you're working to achieve and have a bit of a yarn about like maybe the why you're doing it, but also the why you're doing it. And so what do you think? What do you think you're going to what are the steps to get there maybe over the next little while? Yeah, well, the building, you know, we talked about the training education. Yeah, exactly. That's it's a building. But it's it's not really the building for so but it's a gathering place where like-minded people which around just certain skills can have a have a place to really be a part of the building and it's a place where we can have a conversation and have a conversation about the building. And I think that's what I'm trying to do. And I think it's a really important thing. And I think it's a really important thing. It's a really important thing. We have to have a place that is designated to teach. It's a very technical, clever fireplace. We gather around fire. We gather around fireplaces to learn, learn story, to learn knowledge, to gain knowledge, to be equipped, to be empowered. Yeah. And I think that's what we're trying to do. And I think that's what we're trying to do. Nowadays, though, I mentioned people call that a classroom, you know, and so we get to gather in those classroom spaces now. And but those are places that are those gathering places that they're to. With children. Whether they're going back school and going to the school for courses, they're going to go into one or two courses a day. They go to one or two boarders and get on one of those high and call boarders. So i meet these people to get children on balance into. You know where they go and that's where I need to get in this Maoando gap. They've got or you know, I'm incredibly lucky to be a man, what I'm saying, my就可以 approach. So really it happens. But then I've got one side of this. One thing is Forference. Really other ones have, you know, walking on and it's pretty easy. They do. I've got families and there're a lot of families in the world that can get together with a reason. You know, they have a long service line. of life and live off country. Yeah. But if you don't have that ability to, and you cannot hunt and gather without that knowledge. And so you've got to gather around the fireplace. That's a principle, you know. If you're not gathering around the fireplace, sitting with the elders or the knowledge elders, you miss out. You absolutely miss out. And then, invariably what will happen is that you'll either get very hungry or you'll become dependent upon someone else to go out and hunt and gather for you. And for a man, you know, that's problematic because the spirit man can't be strong. Yeah. And you'll feel flawed and shallow. Yeah. So that's a no good place for us, you know. And we only have to look at, you know, the rights of suicide and young men and especially, yeah, Aboriginal men. And it's a no good thing when their spirit is no good. But your spirit, if you know you're, if you have a sense of, of your place and your space and, or your role and your function, you might not know the fullness of what it is to be a, you know, to hunt and gather uncertain. But you'll have a crack. You'll have a crack. You'll have to have an absolute crack, you know. And sometimes you'll get it and sometimes you won't. Yeah. But, you know, the beautiful thing about spaces where you're coming back to having those places of learning or whether it's the fireplace or the classroom is that you get the ability to hone your skills and sit with knowledge holders and become a little bit more of an effective hunter-gatherer, if that makes any sense. And where you went wrong, you can come back to someone and go, ah. And you tell the story about where you went wrong and you can improve on it. Yeah. And so, yeah, or should be showing a way to do it more effectively or better. One thing we definitely talked about last three days is lots of ideas. Innovation, I guess, is a word that we use for some of it, but also just like problem solving, lots of things. What's, I guess, what's some of the ways you sort of are tackling that or working on that when there's a hundred things to do and a hundred ideas and, you know, you're just trying to get it going. We certainly do. Sometimes we keep thinking of things that we have a slightly bigger project than we have the entire time, you know, and then from saying, okay, we can share that in a variety of ways. You have just told us how life is very different in your job journey that didn't seem like a он means reality, that it's a little bit different for you, but you carry it on. An, yeah. I kinda discovered that I never got into the story of me coming back to America on Costa Rica and traveling, things like that. And so. I mean, yeah. No. But. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, very independent and very much would run ahead and just get it done. You know, almost climb the mountain and go. He's watching, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, probably for the last 18 months to two years, I've been banging on with my team and going, OK, I need you to shine because if you shine, I'll look good. And I do, I'll say to them, come on, I need you to shine, make me look good. And that's been, yeah, that's been part of the journey. But in order for them to shine, they need a whole bunch of things like encouragement and to be able to be listened to and to know where they're coming from. And I've got, I've had to leave my office and walk a little bit over the way towards my workers. Yeah. And to see where they were at. And yeah, and so that's been, that's been good. So rather than do, now we do this thing where instead of me having to walk, I'd gather them and so we'd have team meetings and every morning and we'd have PD and we have all of those things that we other groups that see in the workplace and maybe take for granted, but our guys gather and feed off it and they go, oh, wow. Yeah. And it's and now the beautiful thing is they take the workshops and they run the meetings and they do some of the think tanks. or they'll share what they learned or what happened last week and what have you. And I get the bugger off and sit in the office and find money. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so that's been really good that we're all bang on about empowerment and, yeah, that we model that and we've tested it and we've seen that it actually works. And even when people, though, fall off and feel like they can't rise to the occasion, how many guys have walked away and said, oh, it's all too hard, and then they've circled back and came and went, oh, Rich. It's all right, I've come back. I'll go, yeah, brother, come on. Yeah. Yeah. Is there, I don't know if you think about these words much at all, but we're doing a lot of systems thinking type stuff at the moment and there's a simpler idea with it, I think, which is how is everyone lifting each other up across all of the areas and how are we sharing that, whether it's in community or outside of community? What's some of the ways you're envisaging that and whether it's how do you, like, show what you're doing to community, but also that next layer of, like, how do you show the world, maybe, what's happening in Palm Island, I guess? And is that even something you're thinking about at the moment? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No. Sometimes. When you're in the, what, in the cowfish, yeah, it's really hard to look up because you get the dust in your eyes and you, yeah, and you get the dust in your lungs and it's hard to breathe and, yeah. But then you get some sound bites and some of those sound bites are from people in the community or an uncle and they go, oh, yeah, I really well like what you're doing, you know. Or you get a phone call. And, you know, got a phone call from an elder who said, oh, someone saw me in community, you know. Heard about what, yeah, told me about what's going on. And there was a time in which sometimes you just shy away from that encouragement. You go, ah, you know, damn it. Now I go, oh, gosh, that's a goal. I absolutely needed to hear that. Yeah. Yeah. But with every, but for every good moment, there's probably 10, 15, 20 not so good moments. And so, yeah, you do get, you get weathered and tired. Yeah. And that being said, the whole team gets weathered and tired. And so we're very conscious of the fact that in this particular space, the weight of expectation, however unfounded or undeserved, you know, for a very young group, there's, yeah, there's a heavy weight of expectation on the ranger program. Yeah. And the good thing that we found is I've said to the team, okay, boats left the harbour. Let's just keep pushing forward. Some of the people that you get in the negative stuff, they'll fall in the wake. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And there were some people who go, oh, damn, they're going to paddle really hard, catch up and say, hey, can we jump on board? Let's not wait for people. Let's just keep pushing on. And then let's not go too fast. Just set a steady pace. Because we want those people to catch up. So true. What's, this is a more direct question. I don't really do these direct questions very much. What do you hope that people, like if someone saw the Ranger program and didn't know what it was, what would you hope that they would think, I guess? Like if, say, we were able to see a video or see a story, what would you hope that that story presented and what would you hope that they sort of feel about what you're trying to do? Like maybe they see a few piggies of what happened this morning at the ceremony and it's like, is there a message you would hope that... Yeah. We're in a season right now, I think, of, yeah, leadership development. And I would, yeah, just elements of people just growing in confidence. Yeah. Yeah. I think... Yeah. I mean, we can, you know, we can show a beach clean up with, I don't know, 40, 50, 60 kilos of rubbish. We can do these things where we're doing cultural burns and seeing good grass come back or, you know, and we can have those physical signs of the ecology. But I would hope that if we look at the history of power, if we look at the history of the American people, and the weight of years where people didn't have a lot of... Elders didn't have a lot of, you know, what I call, didn't have a lot of voice, didn't have a lot of choice. That to then see a small remnant of their descendants rising out of the dust. of that history and just owning a space of semi-independence and autonomy and with a space of creativity and purpose and with fire and energy, then you're going to go, oh, yeah, there's something different about this little team. And I'm hoping that little team will actually then grow into a bigger team and be able to almost produce a wave or a movement of change for this place. Yeah. Yeah. I could almost taste it every now and then. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Especially in some of the eyes of these lads when they, you know, they jump in the ute and they're gone. You go, yeah, okay. But they come back and they're sweating and they're talking about what they've done and how excited and you just go, oh, yeah, that's good. So cool, man. Yeah. So we hit half hour, so maybe we can do a couple more questions and wrap it up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think one thing I was thinking about is this bridge metaphor where you have traditional knowledge and then you have like modern day activities that are happening. Like what's, what do you think, do you think the young followers of the bridge, do you think like people coming into the bridge and like how do you see that being successful, bridging cultural knowledge with like what's happening today and like the one thing I always think about is it's almost like the opposite which is like how are we creating a way for the people that are moving too fast in wrong ways to slow down and listen to the, you know, to the indigenous cultural historical knowledge and yeah. I suppose you had two questions. Do you think that's happening on Palm or not and how do you think we maybe do that better, like using that stuff? Yeah, obviously, not obviously, since you're the one obviously, because it's obvious some, it's not obvious for others. But there's, I'll start with this. For some of it, for some people, they were doing people and I think I've talked about that. What do you do earlier as a vocation and what, what happened and, and they get their identity out of what they do. For others, it's where, when I call our small, we're being people, we be, to sit and to be to, and, and it's, it's about occupying a place or a space in relationship to family or to country and so I say we're being people. This is, this is why my job is to be a person. Yeah. Our whole life is about socializing and being a person. Not talking about thekg that we have to battle because it's like, or, you know, we shouldn't come from one night to, or, like, one hey people arrive, they cross together, yeah. we should come from measuring up so that we don't go anywhere in a long time. And the, they're, they're, you know, another layer on, a nutshell, is, is what you do. It's about building on this. You know. Well, to... If you haven't got a job or something like that, and you're unemployed, straight away you're on the left foot. And you go, well, I might be unemployed. And that takes away from who you might be. And so we've got, you know, very much high unemployment in this place. Yeah. What was the question? How do we bridge cultural? Yeah. So one of the things is, for me, is how do we go from a place of brokenness where it's really hard to find who you might be because you've been displaced, you know, to a place where you are who you are. And you know who you might be. And then you participate in that place, what you're doing. And yeah. And so if I come from an angle of the expectation of the mainstream, of come on, guys, we need to go and do things. Oh, they'll go. They'll get the same reaction. They'll just push back at me and go, no, he's barking orders like boss. So what we flip that to say, well, the range of program or member operations is like the tip of the spear. This is what we do. But it's also at the same time who we might be. And on one side, we are informed by our law. We understand ourselves as Aboriginal people. But then and even the brokenness of that, if that makes any sense. So our law has been, you know, but we have a sense of identity in that. And then our LAW, whatever our obligations under the mainstream law, that's the other side of the spear. And we're not going to say, well, let's throw that one away. Let's throw this one away. But we're going to actually use each to inform the operation of what we do. And that'll sharpen our spear. And some of the things we'll use and some things we'll drop off. Even in our law, we might drop off something. As an example, I had one of my workers would say, I have a cultural obligation to go to do sorry business. But I'm going to let that drop off in order for me to be more effective, more present in my work. Now, that's a huge call. It's an absolute huge call. But he said, oh, he is valuing that. We need the vote to push forward. And it's just amazing. Under the law side of things, there are some things in terms of policy and that kind of stuff that we have to ensure. HR and we've got to tick all of those sorts of boxes, you know. But the other side of the coin is we're not going to bow down to every government official or whatever he says and comes knocking on our door and saying, oh, I'm the minister. You know. So, yeah, we might let that drop off and go, oh, very nice to meet you. But, yeah, okay, it's nice to be informed, you know. So there is a sense in which – so I had an old – an elder, Uncle Graham, he would say about both sides of those coins. We've got to work out there's two ways. We need to work out. What we need to adopt, whether it's in law or LAW or LRA, what we need to adapt. So, oh, that's a good thing, but, you know, it might shape it a little bit. And what we might need to abandon, you know. And I go, hmm, well, to let go, you know, for the sake of moving some things forward. So, yeah. And that's how we held the tension of the bridge. Not to build a bridge, but to use each worldview to sharpen our sort of past spirit. That's wicked, eh? We could stop there, bros, or is there another – anything else? Yeah. Oh.",
        "Rich and Ranger\n===\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nRich and Ranger: Ah, there'll be about 15 of us, eh? 10 to 15. Yeah. Maybe more. What's the make up? We'll be everyone together. Yeah. So kayak ranges are based out of here. And they have about 10. Yeah. Some are fee for service. Fee for service ranges run under contracts. Yeah. So they're not full time. They're casual. Yeah. And then we have a state government funding and federal funding through EHP and IAS ranges.\n\nRight. So there's 8 ranges that are employed through the IAS and EHP. Give and take every year, depends on how much money they want to throw back towards kayak. And then, yes, they've got fee for service rangers, the full time rangers are EHP IAS rangers, so they're full time, they get all the entitlements.\n\nAnd then we have Nari Bujong Jarra, that's the National Parks. Nari Bujong Jarra is the National Parks for the islands. So Queensland Parks and Wildlife throw a chunk of money back at kayak to employ the MBD rangers, that's Nari Bujong Jarra. And we [00:01:00] have about four or five of them rangers. that are employed joint management with Queensland Parks and Wildlife.\n\nSo Queensland Parks and Wildlife have about eight rangers that are employed here. Wow. Yeah, so we have Queensland Parks and Wildlife rangers, EHP rangers, IAS rangers, MBD rangers, and we've just started up the Marine Parks. So now we've got Marine Parks rangers getting ready to start on board as well. But also, these two dongers, one of them's based for machine and operations.\n\nSo we got, well I'll show you them in a minute when we go down there, all our tractors, backhoes. So that's a specific staff member that's assigned to, right? Yeah, so that's just for, yeah, that's for the maintenance for tracks and machineries. Yep. And in here's parks. Yep. And kayak. Yep. Say, um, tools, equipment, stuff like that, we'll go and have a look.\n\nAnd Uncle Darren's office is here, and the boss's office is there. So breakdowns and that kind of gear doesn't impact the mangrove operation? No. Because you've got these things. That's right. So if we need to, if we need to use a machine to go and do track [00:02:00] work, Parks will have our own, through Parks, our own tractors and stuff like that.\n\nBut if we don't and we need to use kayak, then we just go to their machine operator and go, Look, we need you to go and do this, so and so, and then he takes that obligation on to make sure that they do. And if they've got a, Charge kayak, or charge anyone, or any parks and that, but they'll do it, so. Yeah, yeah.\n\nYeah, so it's all circles like that. Oh, okay, yeah, so it's circular. Yeah, yeah, all circles. Yeah, um, and then the other one is machinery feeds boats. Yes, machineries. Okay. But then they got another one for boats. Yeah. So in that shed there are two giant boats. Yeah. So that comes under. So let's have a look at that one, then we'll talk through the boats.\n\nIs that alright? Yeah. This is amazing. This is bloody good, because I, I dream this stuff, and the boys just go, You know, and I go, hold on wait a sec, slow up, we've got to be compliant before, yeah. Here we go. These are the old ones, these are some of the [00:03:00] Rangers when they did their first radio, Rodeo for Turtles.\n\nRodeo, wow. This fella here, when he was young, that's him now. Oh wow. Yeah. Oh wow. There's Jakey, he's not up there. Which he's not up there either. But yeah. He's about, what, twelve thirds in there? Yeah. And there he is there. And he works on Morton now. He works on Morton now? Yeah.\n\nThis is all the land areas that we work on. So you can have asparagus, but asparagus grows everywhere through the whole island. So we don't just look after Australia. We've got goat island, bird island. Peel Island, all these other bay islands that we have to manage and look after too, um, but yeah, Bidu bush surveys, track maintenance, could be on any track on the island, planned burns, Yarramin walking tracks, so we've got walking tracks we've got to maintain for the tourists and tourist season.\n\nUm, yeah, everything. [00:04:00] Dry rainforest, so we've got dry rainforest and a wet rainforest. So, can I just focus, come back, because we've got a real interest on Yarrawin. Yep. In terms of, I want to shoot them all. Yeah, yeah. And I'm going to hold them, I'm going to go, okay, oh well, now I'm going to manage them all.\n\nYeah. So, you've got a designated area where those things go, so they don't impact on the rest of the country. Yep. Brilliant. That's it. Brilliant. Yeah, that's the way. That is good. And then sea country. That is good. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. A great management. Has a great management. Well, I'll see you next time.\n\nCrazy. That's just our conference room. That's where we have all our meetings. Oh yeah. Okay. Projector. So everything goes. There's our map. And the island. Oh my lord. So that's only one island. So there's another one. Moreton Island. Yep. I see you manage Moreton too. Yes. So, we have about 10 rangers on Moreton Island now.\n\nThat are employed through Kayak, Edmund Campen. And they're full time rangers [00:05:00] that work over there. So we're still looking to employ more. So the good thing with Kayak is they only employ bloodline descendant people. They don't employ non Indigenous people because it's an Aboriginal organisation. We're there to empower our people and uplift them.\n\nIf someone else was wanting to work as a ranger, we'd tell them to apply for a job through Queensland Parks and Wildlife because Queensland Parks and Wildlife is still dictated by government and you can be built for benefit. But also we own Min Camping and Min Camping run all the campgrounds. So there's about 15 campsites along Flinders.\n\nAnd another 2, 000 sites along Main Beach. So we own, run and manage them. So we can also employ non Indigenous people to help manage them parts of Country as well. But for Kayak, for the Rangers through Kayak, and Moreton Island, we try to employ Indigenous people, Bloodline Descendants. Yeah. Because there's over 600 members for Kayak and 12 family.\n\nReps. Yep. So the head 12 family reps. Yep. And then your board, your CEO, [00:06:00] everyone else all filters down. Yeah. But the head honchos are them 12 family reps. Yeah. All the 12 family reps have all grandkids and kids and kids, you know, there's a big line of people there that need to get up and start getting shit done.\n\nYeah. Help benefit our people and get shit done for the future. Yeah. For the kids. That's how I see it. So everyone get up and do it, you know. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. Well, this is all mining weeks. But it all got handed back. Oh my god. So pretty much from here down was all mining leased. So no mines anymore? Nah, nah.\n\nBut it's still blocked off. A lot of it's still all locked off and you can't access it. Um, yeah. You've only got three roads. You've got one road that goes here out to Main Beach. Yeah. And that's it. You're allowed to cruise along the beach. And then you have the other road that goes out to Emmity Point.\n\nYeah. And then to Point Lookout. You can't go anywhere else off the track. There's only one more track that goes through the island here and that's you can that's the access for drive track for tourists Yeah, but you can't go off it and you can't go anywhere [00:07:00] else. Okay, so from here So now we're going into the future ecotourism mining is leaving Yeah, we've got to open up ground for tourists.\n\nYeah to visit but also access this cultural significant areas Yeah, so blue lakes men's sacred water like yeah We will open it up, but educate them not to swim in the lake. So now we've done 20Ks of walking tracks, all the way around. Um, it's World Heritage listed. So you can't send machines. We do. Yeah, they've got to be done by hand.\n\nSo you've got to GPS the tracks, and then go back through with mattocks, muddocks, and muck rakes, shovels, chainsaws, you name it. Yeah, all them tracks were done by hand. And now they're doing another track. We just did one out here near Tripod Hill. Now there's a track that's about 10 K's in here. And now they're doing another track out this way.\n\nSo yeah. 10 K? Yeah. Oh, all up, over, just the one here is [00:08:00] about 20 K's. This one's about 10 K's, and this one will probably be more. And they're still working on this one. They've still got about 800 metres left. Wow. All by hand, no machine. Yeah, no machine at all. Yeah, that's, that's to keep yourself fit. But everything from here, south, except the beach, has been, has not been accessed because of the mining lease.\n\nSo you have to have a mining permit, mining inductions, blah, blah, blah, whatever. So, in saying that, my father and a lot of old people have gone to their graves, not even allowed to access any part of country south of Dunnidge. So when government comes through and go, when are you going to open up the gate so we can all go down to the south end?\n\nOr when you get the followers on the, on the bay islands, when are you going to build a bridge across here so we can go to Australia? It's like, sorry, no fucking bridge coming here because my ancestors and my people didn't even get enough time to see that country. So we got to manage it and look after it.\n\nSo our people can go in there before we exploit it to [00:09:00] tourism and tourists. So yeah, still a lot of blocked off country. That, that's a great story. Um, I need my old people to hear that because you get pushed and pulled. Oh yeah. Yeah. But, um, yeah. Yeah. There's that much country that our mob haven't seen. So my thing is when they complain and go or what track are you going to open up for the tourists to go down?\n\nSo I looked at this track here, and this is an old track that used to run from Emberty point to point lookout So my idea was Open that track up. He's already fucked it all up. He's already ruined it all. Go and ruin that one again. Yeah, it's not hasn't been open for years. Yeah, instead of trying to create a whole new track down here and destroy good perfect land It's like I can't keep destroying the land.\n\nYou already destroyed. Yeah. Yeah, and instead of them instead of them swimming here We say go swim in the keyholes because this keyholes is man made from the mines. So the mines made this So it's like go destroy your man made lake. So yeah, [00:10:00] so what? Similarly, but not on this sort of level of scale. Yeah, we would do walking tracks and lead them away from places.\n\nYep. And then the other thing that we would do is, yeah, it's about auditing and making sure that, yeah, you know where those story places are. Yeah. Yeah, it's just, it's hard, hard bloody work. Yeah. But we always push. Yep, like we'll go through here. Our main threat's all in here, and that's a big swamp, 18 mile swamp.\n\nSo literally 18 miles long. So if a fire was to start here, it's not going to stop. If a fire starts anywhere in that swamp, it just all lights up. Yeah. And then it wraps around, and these are all little swampy edges off the edge of the island. Yeah. And these are all like swamp. So when the fire goes up on the island, it goes up bad.\n\nThat's why you always hear about it on the news, because Australia's just full of shit. Is this beech or mangrove? Nah, beach. Beach. Yeah, and then that's all, all um [00:11:00] So the swamps catch the runoff, huh? Oh yeah. There's paper barks, everything in that peat mine. It's all peat. Everything. So And then down here we've got our cypress camps.\n\nAnd boring. There's a boring and a cypress camp down along here. Okay. So the cypress trees down there are 500 to 1, 000 years old. So the trees wouldn't get that old unless someone maintained the land underneath them. Yeah. And that was our mob. And when the fire goes through, you see all the shells and stone artifacts under it.\n\nYeah. So it's class. So we've gone and down there with machines to mulch. Because all that growth for 50 years, I'm not looking after country. Yeah. So all them banksies have grown up for the last 50 years because we've all been stuck in town. Yeah. So now we send the rangers down there to go and take all that undergrowth out to save the cypresses.\n\nYeah. Cypress camps down there that look like rainforests though. Yeah. Cake is down there. That is fantastic. It's mad. Yeah, it's fantastic. Go out the back way, yeah, look, we'll go look for some more stuff. Wow. Look at how long you've had it for. Well, I'm going to have [00:12:00] two shots of this. I'm, I'm, I'm Youse off today or tomorrow?\n\nYeah, uh, today, but Here, look this way. You'll have to come back. I'm going to try and come back before Um, before. As you can see all our lockers, all our fire gear. Oh, sorry. You alright? Lockers. I'd love to get a fire. The stuff that our rangers. Yeah. I just say, where's our lockers? And they go, Oh, yeah, okay.\n\nThis makes it easier. Crazy, crazy, good. Someone's sitting here. How do you manage, how do you manage, um, uniforms and stuff? Um, I just buy them, order them and buy them. Have they got sort of like, okay, you get a certain amount, a certain amount given to you. And then after that, yeah. With Parks and Wildlife, it's all online.\n\nSo Parks and Wildlife are linked in with Workwear. So Workwear have their own [00:13:00] category, you're allowed, you know, eight shirts, eight long pants and then you've got all these other shirts and shorts and boots and everything. You just go and order it all and they send it back. With Kayak, they've got to put a order in, they get it, get it embroidered and send it back as well that way.\n\nOkay, cool. There you go. They've got their big fire bag. Yeah, yeah. Full of stuff. See, some of them have got wet shirts, so when we go out on warm water country. Yeah.\n\nOur boys want to go to the standards, but they've got all that bull. Ah, good job. Yeah, they got it, yeah. So all our Rangers at least have fire level one ticket. Yeah. So they can all go out and hit fire. Some of us have fire level two. Yeah. So that's crew leader, so you can run the whole sector. Yeah. And then some of us have the IC, so the incident control.\n\nEven runs that whole fire sector again. Wow. So that was the idea, was to not be dictated. By QFIS or other people coming [00:14:00] over when it comes to a fire ground telling us blackfellas what to do on the ground So it's like fuck this we go and train our mob up. Yeah to get them qualifications So when a fire happens, we run it we control it and they listen to us.\n\nYeah. Yeah, that's the big benefits there with that one Do you do cultural grounds now? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so we mix the cultural stuff within Yeah, so we just don't, we just, they haven't given us authority to start nightburns, which I think is the money factor. But we need to work out a way this year where we can do more nighttime burns than we are daytime burns.\n\nYeah. Only because of that coolness in the, in the temperature. Yeah, we, on Palm Ridge, it's nighttime. Yeah. We light up in the afternoon and away you go. So this little thing in here, this is all the kayak gear. Right. So the kayak rangers and FIFA service rangers, they get their bit of money and they throw all their stuff in here.\n\nWill's over there servicing the saw now. How you going Will? How old are you Will? [00:15:00] 21. 21! Alright. My boys absolutely just drives me nuts. Nah, they're going to love it. Yeah, that's how all the chainsaws have got marks on it. So here's got kayak and it's got the 5037. Yeah, so that belongs in the truck 5037.\n\nYeah, specifically for that. And that's why he's cleaning it now because he's used, he's pulled it out of the truck, used it, and he's gonna go put it back. Yeah. Otherwise if you want to use one not out of the truck, there's Hunter here, all stuff. So you've got policy and procedure about. If you use it, you clean it straight away that day.\n\nIt has to be cleaned that day. Otherwise you can get growled by. Well, cause there's everyone around. We shit stir each other. Yeah. In a good way. So, you know, if it makes you want to do it next time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not like, fucking go clean it now or you're going to lose your job. It's like, nah. And everyone just shit stirs each other.\n\nSo they end up getting it done. Nah, that's good. Yeah, in a good way. Yeah, I know. Yeah. We got a lot of young ones too. So the [00:16:00] young ones are good. They need to learn. So it's good for them to So work culture is, is a big, work culture is a good here. Yeah, good option. Yeah, everyone gets along well. Yeah.\n\nEveryone gets along then. How long did it take you to build that? Oh, it's always menia. Because we all grew up with each other on the island. We all know each other since we were all little kids. These boys, when I was little. Little, little, you know? These fellas would teach my kids. That's what's going to happen.\n\nI'm going to teach my kids, these fellas are going to teach my kids. And that's how we want it. Yeah, back out burner. I see you've got cameras. Yeah, yeah, we have. They're not so much for our rangers in case someone comes in to steal shit. Yeah. So your generator is under here? That's got our fire gear. The state's locked because some rangers like to take stuff without telling.\n\nYeah. But um, so with the fire gear we're talking clamps, hoses, attachments. Yeah. Everything's all in there. So we buy everything. So if something fucks [00:17:00] up we got it here ready to go. Yeah. That one there has all the Makita saws, everything Makita. Toolboxes, we're always buying new fucking toolboxes every year because tools go walkabout with blackfellas.\n\nYeah. Every Makita thing you can think of. Yeah. That's mainly for the platforms, walkways. You know, a little battery saw, if you don't want to use a petrol powered one, angle grinders. Okay. Everything. I've got, I've got a storeman here, um, William, I need to send down there and spend some time. Yep. You can't, you can't tell them, you get someone to show them, then they can model.\n\nYeah. Do you have trucks like these? Sorry, we haven't got, I live on, we've got eight islands to look over, we haven't even got a boat, so, yeah, crazy. Ah, this is good. But that's also, see [00:18:00] that? That's a table, you pull the table out, and you've got a table to do your servicing. Oh, okay, fair enough. 300 litre tank, or this one I think is a bit bigger.\n\nSo that's QPWS standard? Yep, this one is, yeah. And we try and get the kayak cars exactly the same. Yeah. They might have a different pump set up. Yeah. So that car over there, that's a kayak car. That one. So, so he looks after your, um, in terms of the standard of work truck. Every, as, as Toyota, he, he does that for you.\n\nNah, we got a mechanic just up the road here, Rick Lewis. Yeah. I'll take his up there in a minute. Yeah. So Rick Lewis just up the road, he does all the, Like if there's something wrong, we send it straight to him. He fixes it, get back on the road again. Okay. So today you had to fix two of the fire trucks up, the pumps weren't working too good.\n\nYep. But that's the same with Kayak as well. Kayak and MBD, if they have something wrong, we just send it straight up to Rick Lewis. Yeah. And he's our fabricator, mechanic, slash everything. Yep, the lighting setup. [00:19:00] Yeah, they are good. Yeah. This one, this is a good truck because it's got all the switches here.\n\nSee?\n\nOh, ho, ho.\n\nThey fixed it. That was the problem. This here was, wasn't working.\n\nThat's all more fly hoses and attachments. [00:20:00] Ah, yeah. So\n\nit says, you, you can hold 300, 300 litres. Yep. Yeah, 300 litres in that little back lip. F k me. It's got the chainsaws. This side of the issue though. What's in there? Oh, yeah. Tools, your toolbox. Cleaning stuff. And whatever else you want to put in there. Yeah, nice. Yeah, it's good the single cabs are good. You can store everything on them.\n\nSingle cabs, not dual. Yeah, OK, gotcha. You can hold more water on it too. Yep.\n\nFuck.\n\nYou got washing machines and dryers in there for your Yeah. [00:21:00] bits and pieces. And there's a freezer. They bought a big giant freezer there. Wow. For, it's a biohazard one. So, sometimes you get called in or you get animals Yep. that have, um, been attacked by dogs. Yep. And you need to keep it to send back over town for forensics.\n\nYep, yep. Because we're on a remote island. Yeah. So we'll freeze them, put them in a garbage bag, freeze it and put it in there until Okay. until they want it over town. Right.\n\nSo, in terms of training, tell me about KPWS training standards and Training? Yeah. Oh, training whenever we're not doing fires. Yep. So, we just finished our coxswains. Yeah. So I just finished that. Um, compliance training, whatever training we need, they'll get it done ASAP. Yeah. Yeah. Fire. Everything. I've just done the drone course.\n\nYep. So some of us can fly drones up to 25 kilos. Yep. And that's with the thermo imaging. Yep. And I use them for koalas before we [00:22:00] do burns. Okay. They go spotting koalas. Right. Excellent. So they're two parks machines. Okay. That's, we've still got two more of these on Peel Island, so Peel Island's the island out in the middle.\n\nYeah. And it's just easier to get around on. Yeah. These are used to get into some of the cypress camps, because we can't drive our four drives in there. Yeah. This one was used for swamps, because it's an amphibian, you can drive it straight into the water. That's why this is here, for the motor. Yeah. You take the tank out, so this tank comes out, there's two little seats in the back.\n\nPut a motor on the back of this and drive straight into the water and it floats. So it's an amphibian Mad machine this one. Yeah, so with the large swamp area We're breaking the swamp up into three sections or four sections This here can help make a track straight through the swamp Yeah And then keep running over that track and then you can cut that swamp in the sections and burn off In little areas instead of having a whole [00:23:00] swamp burn Have it burnt off in little sections And this is the machine to help get through the swamp.\n\nOkay. Where the other ones won't get through it. Yeah. Yeah. That's a community boat. So the land council bought that like 15 years ago. Help me out. Community boat. What do you mean by that? Anyone in the community can buy it. You can have a, not buy it, but use it. Yeah. To go hunting for turtle, whatever. Yeah.\n\nMaybe if you want to go fishing. So me and my kids have been, we were using that over the Christy holidays. Yeah. There's a big tube in there. So I've been towing around on the tube. Yeah. So yeah, community boat, but you gotta have a bit more, a bit of experience out of being driving boats, like you can't just take it if you just got your boat license.\n\nYeah. So yeah, we're, who's got a key? I need a key. I'll see if Bailey's still here. Let me ring him. We'll keep going around here while I'm waiting to get a key for this gate, this big thing here. We might have to bounce in like 10 as well. Yeah, okay. Hey? We might have to bounce in about 10 minutes. Yep.\n\nWe're gonna [00:24:00] do the 2. 30 barge. Oh, lucky. Yeah, we're going to do a lap around here and we're done. The boats are in that shed, so I'm going to ring someone, but we've got a couple of machines around here. That's a mulcher, an 18 inch mulcher, one of the biggest mulchers you can buy. Yeah,\n\nthere Uncle Darren's, he's redoing this one up. So using that from parts. Okay. Are you on base? Oh, are you gone? Yeah, of course. When are you coming back? Never? Oh, I'll see you when you get back. Righto. See ya. Righto. That's a steam weeder. So we want to try and get out of chemicals used for weeds. Can you repeat that again?\n\nSteam weeder? Steam weeder. It's um, [00:25:00] used for Yeah. So instead of using chemicals, this will produce hot water, and the hot water will kill your weeds. Yeah. So any weeds that are around, it's got the big hoses on the back, 60 metre hoses. Wow. Goes through here, goes into the big boiler, at a certain temperature, will, will kill any weeds you can think of.\n\nYeah. So, yeah, 50, 000 machine. With the two hoses on the back of it, so. Wow. And being on an island, that's what we're trying to do, is get away from using chemicals on spraying, anything on country, and use the steam heater because it's just straight hot water. And it doesn't affect anything. Wow. And these should have,\n\nSo they're all the different attachments. So if you're attacking big weeds, smaller weeds, and if you want to get asparagus, Because asparagus it's hard to get in, that, get into the crown, and just hit it with the steam weeder, and you're laughing, and that'll kill it. [00:26:00] So that's the way to go. Plus, I reckon, if you get a hold of one of these, same, because we're on the island now, so if we got this, we can dictate to Raelyn City Council, and other agencies, that look to go and spray chemicals on country, we can dictate and tell them, no, no more spraying chemicals, we've got a steam weeder, you can employ us.\n\nContract us to go and do the weed work for you. Otherwise they'll go buy a steam weeder, then you have two steam weeders on an island. So we've got to tap into that. I want this to tap in with the, they've got a girls rangers crew coming up soon. So as a main in source for the fee for service rangers.\n\nThis is going to be an in source for them to keep their money rolling until they've got employed. So if they can get a contract off everyone for this, then that's one source of income for fee for service. Very clever. Very clever. Probably, uh, they're like a fuel container, aren't they? What's that? Ah, nah, that's just our storage ones.\n\nSo she can store, yeah, anything. I think [00:27:00] one's kayaks, one's Oh, yeah, one is fuel. Um, so What's this, what's this used for? Polities. No, no, the bloody skid, skid steer. Yeah, skid steer. So, there's two of them. So Kayak bought two min campers, got one, and there's one on Moreton Island for the Moreton crew. What do you use this for?\n\nMulching our tracks. Mulching your tracks. Mulching tracks, fire tracks, fire trails, track maintenances, you name it. So you've got the big mulcher on the front. They also got a, they got a excavator with a six metre boom on it with a mulcher on it as well. So that can do hillsides. So this one's flat ground.\n\nThen anything on the hillsides, we send the excavator through with the arm, and then he hits the hillsides. And that's the way to go. Okay. Oh yeah. And then we, and then after that's done, then we just use the tractors, and the tractor slashers to maintain everything. Okay. [00:28:00] Heavy lifting and Fuck. That's crazy good stuff.\n\nI don't think this is open. Nah, key locked. I left my keys in the bloody other truck and the girls took it. Okay. Well, it just means that I'll send you photos of the boat when they come through. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we've got two boats in here. One's a mini barge that can fit the side by side on. So literally put the ramp down.\n\nA mini barge. And you can drive the side by side on it. And the other one's a big inflatable boat for the elders. So it was mainly, it's like a fisheries and a police boat. Yeah. A big inflatable one. So that was used for the elders to get them off and off on the beaches with the ramp at the front. Yep. And now we just upgraded to another boat that's going to be here next year.\n\nOkay. About, yeah, nearly a million dollar boat. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a [00:29:00] fully closed and cabin one. So when you come to the boat, um, in terms of QPW, okay, I'll keep banging on back to that. So. So do you put, how does that work? Like you get a certain amount of dollars. Yep. To bloody run your main, your operations.\n\nBut if you need capital expenditures, do you have to apply for it? Or you put a request in? How does that work for you? I think we put a request in for what we want. Yeah, that's another boat. That was our NAIDOC day. Is that a stabie? Do that again. Oh, okay. It's in there. Yeah, it's got wheels on it. Shit, man.\n\nYeah. That's the one for you, you just fail. Then you just go straight into the water. Dale, look. That thing looks like a little airplane. Yeah, pretty much.[00:30:00] \n\nThat's so cool. Have you done, um, any other sort of cultural exchanges with other rangers in Queensland? Uh, we've been up to Bunya Mountains. We do the senior ranger indigenous programs over town. But nothing, no one's really come to the island to do one yet. So it needs to happen. When the palm moth come, it'll be the first time.\n\nYeah, that pretty much will be the first time. Yeah. You go up to the palm. Oh, they'll love it. There's plenty here for them to do. Well, I think it, it's not so much also one with one visit having, having the elders, then the other would be to, for us to then program it. Yep. So we talked to our in indigenous, um, range of program and I said, look, I, I, I need our guys to be, it's one thing to be in the mainstream space.\n\nIt's another thing to be taught. Different sort of standards and that kind of stuff by your own, and Yeah, that's right. Cause you just, [00:31:00] you just lift your game, sort of thing. Whereas you, some of the times the boys are just going, Ah, F him, you know, because of that race stuff, and you go, Oh, they gotta get that out of their head.\n\nYou gotta get, nah, you can't do that boys. Nah. I'm trying to see if I've got the photo of these other boats here. Yeah. Saw a cool, um, Iveco Daily 4x4 this morning. Where's that? One of your rain shoes. Oh, yeah. He's going out in it. Yeah, we've got to swap that over, eh? Nah, some belt keeps breaking in on the front of it.\n\nSo we keep getting it fixed. So we're going to get a new one. But I don't think they should get another Iveco. They should just get a Land Cruiser. Because we're always struggling for, for fucking cars. That's like this morning we were struggling for cars. Nah, I can't even fortify it, eh. So the Iveco, you didn't learn?\n\nOh, I tried it off the drive. It's too big. Too bumpy and, yeah. Well, some of the rangers love it. So they, [00:32:00] yeah, they like it, but I don't. Ah, okay, cool. Yeah, when I get photos, I'll send them to you on that boat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, they're pretty big. So, yeah, again, the idea was just to touch base, sail low and have a look, see?\n\nYep. The other thing was, we're hoping to come back in February, March. Yep. I mean, we're hoping to bring elders and some, some rangers and do a few things instead for, you know, three, four days, something like that. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, and um, and then connect in. How many are you hoping to bring down? Uh, it would, yeah, it'll probably be, uh, two senior staff.\n\nYep. And maybe, um, and some elders, um, elder rangers. Yeah, yeah. You know, initially. Yep. And then, and then that, then. Um, those, they will then start to hatch a plan about what would this look like in terms of maybe even formalising something. Yep. That, that we, that is done on a regular basis. Yeah, cause we'll take you for a drive down the south then.\n\nYeah. To them [00:33:00] Cypress camps. Where they've been working and. Yeah. Other places on the island and even if we can get our senior boat in and take him out on the boat for a cruise. Yeah. So one of the islands or something. Yeah. And I know that every man and his dog will wanna, um, come but I think. If we can just manage that so we're mobile.\n\nYeah, yeah, that's right. And then that way then we can plan accordingly and then Yep. And the goal will be that in my headspace, we've said to the guys, look, I want you to go and potentially do a, um, either of 'em 10 day or a month stint in another spot. Yep. Um, yeah. And, but yeah, and, and I've talked to the department saying about and they just went, yeah, absolutely.\n\nYeah. That's it. You know, and if, if one of the social benefits is that you have people from that country who have been removed, who are connecting to their own story, yeah, that's right, that's crazy. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. No, Australia's a good, good example and [00:34:00] a lot we can offer a lot of, a lot of people in a big way.\n\nYeah. And then the other part then, our senior Natalie, I'd love to be able. Like, who manages your backend, your, in terms of your administration and that kind of stuff? Yeah, in the shade, go this side. That's not you, is it? Nah, I was doing it. Nah, we've got other people that are in there. Yeah. That can help feed, feed your information there.\n\nYeah, yeah. Yeah. So Natalie would love to be in that. My senior would love to, yeah, just spend a week here and just get energized. Yeah, that's right. See what's going on and take it back home. Yeah, yeah, so that's a good. Yeah I always say it's good motivation for the younger ones. Yeah. Especially the younger lazy ones, that wanna do stuff.\n\nWhat did you do today, Leroy? Nah, that's not work. Ha ha ha ha ha. Alright, get in here, get that dog.[00:35:00] \n\nWho the fuck is, oh there's a dog. Oh crap, yeah yeah yeah. He was running down that person again. Ha ha ha ha. Nah, Stradi's good. The good thing here with Parcs is, they get better help. Where some parks over town, they got nothing. Because we got an Aboriginal Land Council and parks, they can get everything and anything.\n\nOh wow. So if they want a new car, or if they want a new boat, and they can justify it, like elders need it, whatever, you know, blah, blah, blah. And if kayak don't have enough money, then parks can throw in half. State government can throw in a third of it. Oh, so you just, oh my gosh. It's got three ways in it.\n\nYeah. It's smarter, not harder. Oh, wow. And that's why I try to tell it, Morton Island, because Morton Island had national parks over there too. And they didn't want, it took us five years to get our claim on Morton Island. Yeah. Because the park rangers over there didn't want nothing to do with the native titles and Aboriginal people.\n\nWhich boat are you on? This one or near the barge? Uh, the one near the barge. The, uh, [00:36:00] Sea Week one. Yep. Yeah, so it took over five years because them fellas didn't want nothing to do with blackfellas coming to take over country. Yeah. And I tried telling them, I was like, yeah. Because they were scared their jobs were going to get missed out.\n\nI said, you're not going to lose your job. I said, you'll have your same job, don't worry about that. I said, but you see that tractor? How old is that tractor? Oh, it's old, it's shit and all this. I said, don't you want a new tractor? Well, what do you mean? So if you link up with Kayak and the Aboriginal Land Council, I said we'll go halves on a brand new tractor for this island, and you've got a brand new tractor.\n\nI said, but if you want to carry on like an idiot, I said, we'll just leave that shitty tractor here for you and you'll get nothing. So now they're starting to realize. Yeah. Oh shit, we better work in with these fellas. We get new equipment. Yeah. And when we first started the Ranger Base, we used to get all the hand me down stuff from the mainland.\n\nYeah. So they used to send us all the second hand stuff from the mainland, but now it's turned around. It's like, nah, we get all the brand new stuff and we give them all our hand me down stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's the way you want it. Yeah. [00:37:00] Yeah. At the end of the day, that's all our government money, you know, that's all natural resources.\n\nWe should be entitled to do what we've got to do with it, any way we have to. Yeah, well, see we've got this indigenous ranger program, and I just go, well, I'll fund them to the level of QPWS. And they go, yeah, well you've got to train them. We're looking up to the same country. So, Rich, do we need to grab, um, do you mind if we go to the, um, rec center?\n\nYou know, the recreational accommodation just here on the right? Oh, yeah, yeah, a, um, cup of Richard's?\n\nOh, um, where's, um,\n\nJess? She's down there. She's down at the, um, the baron. Right, we should get in here? Yeah, do you want to come across? Sure, I can give you a lift down, I don't mind. Yeah.\n\nNick, thanks for that. That's right, unless, um, I can, as well. Do [00:38:00] you want to train now, Rich, or do you want to go a bit later today? Um, nah, I might, yeah, I might jump out. Yep. Yeah, cause, my hope is that I'll, I'll come back for, for a few days and bring my vehicle home. Yeah.\n",
        "  \"text\": \" Action. Kel? Happy about that? Look at Nico there, Richard. Oh, okay. See? So you don't look in the camera, you look off camera. That's the better side. Well, now you say it like that. Funny. Initially, I actually went, oh, gosh, that's an attachment to the cannon. Then I went, oh, no, how the hell is that? Two times the cannon. I don't know how to say it. Two times the action. Mmm. Maybe let's start with the easy stuff, Rich. Where are we right now? Where are we right now? Yeah. So we're at the top of Mount Bentley. More specifically, this is where we we are endeavoring to have a plant propagation so i suppose and this is the uh second field i call it yeah what country are we yeah so mount bentley so is uh um yeah this is myumburra Country. Yeah, so a little ways over to my shoulder to my right is a little waterhole there that's the Gabba Dreaming. So we're not far from one of the story places, one of the key story places for our mob, the Carpetake Dreaming. What's your connection to culture? What's your cultural connections to? Yeah, this place. Yeah, so this is my grandmother's country. And she's a mum of a woman We married a Nahuatl man. So Nahuatl country is 30k, you know, in that area where we called Ingham and down to Rolling Stone, that's the Great Divide. That's Nahuatl country. But grandfather would say to me, you know, Richie, you're always gonna look after your grandmother's country. So a very long road to coming back and to this place and just the honor of carrying out my cultural obligation to that story, looking after grandmother's country. What does country mean to you? Um, oh gosh, here we go. Yeah, connection. Um, yeah, provides connection, belonging. Yeah, it's a space that keeps me grounded. But also grounded because our story, our mambla story is written in this country here. So different places, different story places. It grounds me and it keeps me centered. And in a sense, gives me a purpose and joy. Yeah, yeah. We're going to dive into a few different, um, uh, sort of cultural stories that are profound in your wisdom and sharing. But before we do that, like what's, what's story mean to you and what's the significance of story in your life? Hmm. Yeah. Um, yeah. So I think it's, it's come out of or in response to, um, navigating, um, what I call the doing culture in Australia which is what do you do when you grow up I'm going to be something and this is what I'll do and so yeah so that sense of yeah it's a long way of saying, you know, that I went and got an education, I got a trade, I got a degree and there were things that I did. But that didn't translate into my belonging or my sense of who I am. Yeah. So what was the question? Who are you then? Yeah. So, so in a sense, um, country helps me be, and helps me be me, um, and helps me understand who I am. And it's out of that that from that base of where I land and say okay that I can work out what my doing is going to be you know if that makes any sense talk me through this idea of our story our story so yeah our story story comes out of the narrative of, there was a time when I had two stories. I had a doing story and a being story. The doing story is what I did to earn a cut of living, to be able to provide for family, to, and do those things that every Australian, in terms of the Australian narrative, the quarter acre block, yeah, I could do that and did it a couple of times and then went hmm. So that was one story. and then went hmm so that was one story um um the other story of who i am and uh which you i didn't fully understand or know that when granddad said you're going to look after your grandmother's country I did not know the fullness of what that meant, if that makes any sense. And so that's been a journey. It's been a journey to sit with elders, to find the place of their belonging, to find those stories and in a sense I couldn't work out what I needed to do in that space until I could be in that space. And so that meant that I had to be on country and have time with my old people and time around the fire and time around understanding stories um and time to be quiet um to learn um yeah how do we as a well i guess um talk me through this um the story you shared very generously around like tell me your, I'll tell you my story, and let's create our story. Talk me through that and where does that come from? Yeah, so I couldn't, you can't do something or give advice to someone about those sorts of things unless you walk the walk, if that makes any sense. Those sorts of things unless you walk the walk that makes any sense So in a sense I had to join those two stories together and then work out What my story was going to be? Interesting so So in really I Navigate those two worlds Intuitively inside almost all day every day. So I've got this dominant culture side and I've got this, yeah. But then, and this cultural side. And one informs each other. What the amazing thing is, though, is that I can take that model and translate and almost use it as a vehicle to engage not only first people to engage because I say to my cousin brothers or who I'm talking to or my colleagues or my the workers under me, we've got to navigate these two wells but for you to understand these two wells you've got to navigate these two worlds. But for you to understand these two worlds, you've got to know your own world. So it is about knowing your story first. That's the first thing. The second thing then is that when we engage in that space with the two worlds and with the other world, with the other understanding, with the other world, with the other understanding. There are people who are wanting to come into this space and would love to be able to engage with me or my people. And I say to folk, well, tell me your story and I'll tell you my story and then we'll try and figure out how my story and your story can become an our story. The principle doesn't change, it's the practice if that makes any sense and so that's the interesting space. It's a very, I think, it's an easier vehicle to be able to engage with conversation as human beings, rather than as first people, second people, or whatever construct you want to use, if that makes any sense. Story is a good vehicle to be able to work on, because everyone understands that story, yeah, that concept of story. Talk me through the story of the sphere, and the two sides of the the spear and what that means to you? Yeah. So that story was gifted to me by a brother from Bundjalung country, Cole Slatt, the story of two brothers and how those brothers had a certain cultural obligation to work on and in order for them to be able to execute on that they had to be in relationship with one another. They not only had to be in relationship with one another and understand how to, I guess, make that spear, how to find that spear, how to straighten that spear, but they also knew and understand that they also needed others to be able to get into that space and produce that spear. And so that concept of the knowledge holder and the one that yearns or thirsts that knowledge was a respectful transaction. Yeah, and so it was out of that that I was able to then look at my relationship with my brother, my grandfather's relationship with his brother and the sense that we all had gifts, we all had strengths, we all had, I wouldn't say weaknesses, but things that we were reliant on the other to bring into the space. yeah we're dependent on one another so that was really interesting to to to then have that story gifted to myself and then able to then say oh actually we know that story that story is actually embedded in the space. So we also learned that in that space, you know, it's almost like pulling a string. Once you start that thread about that story, you go, oh yeah, well, yeah, and by the way, no one holds that old story. And it just keeps going on and you go, oh, okay. So, yeah, part of the spear is that we learn now, to put it in today's context, how you talk about the one brother who's, or the one story that comes from First Peoples, and we talk about L-I-Y-R-E. I talked to my alpha and I said, we've got to navigate this new story that's come into the asbestos because the environment's changed. So we call it the L-I-W story. And so when we make this spear, this one that enables us to cut a path into this landscape, we actually need two sides of the story, the L-O-R-E and the L-A-W. And yeah, and so in that sense, we're sensitive to brothers and sisters who come to this place, who've got a heart to stand in respectful conversation with us, who say, tell me your story. And this is our story. And we go, oh. And then we say, how can my story and your story become in our story the other part of that two registered spear despair is that there is this the spear has two edges but there's there's a body in that spearhead um and so part of the the body of that spirit is the conversations, the respectful conversations that we have, whether it's through individuals, whether it's through councils, whether it's through CEOs and those are the conversations that happen. The mechanism that we have within that spirit is held in the shaft and the interesting thing is now we say, well, what's in the shaft and the interesting thing is now we we say well what's in the shaft well the shaft is all of our policies and procedures and how we and and our hr documents and how we i guess um give backbone to that spirit and if you don't have those elements And if you don't have those elements, what you've got is two edges and you haven't got any drive sort of thing, you know. Yeah, and then I think even if you talk about the length of that spear and how it powers, part of what drives that spear to be able to have an impact in community is, you know, the vision that an organisation or a person that has. It might be in, you know, the strategic plan, whatever that is, but it's trying to make sense of, for my people, how can we use a cultural artifact to understand what we're going to do? And yeah, and when we say, oh, yeah, this is going to drive and power up our spirit, then we need those elements in there, if that makes any sense. we need those elements in there, if that makes any sense. So it's a helpful way to understand that construct because then what happens is that as we then build organisations, we've got a young organisation, Mumba Operations, we then can figure out, because we use spears to hunt fish, and we go, oh, well, now we're oh, well, now we're hunting for particular fish. So we want the Goggin who understands how to do finance, the Goggin who understands business, and the one who helps us shape policies and procedures and whatever. And so we're a bit sharper about who it is that we're after, if that makes any sense. Talk me through the Barnum and what have you. And so we're a bit sharper about who it is that we're after, if that makes any sense. So talk me through the Bhanam and the Gogan. So that's probably the key story that holds how we operate, if that makes any sense. So, yeah, that you have a knowledge holder and then you also have the one that you... So, yeah, you can't really talk it through except to say, this is how it works. And then once someone grabs that understanding then did you work it out in your practice. That story is dependent though in its practice for for entities to hold each other's story in balance or gently, if that makes any sense, and respectful conversations. It's not to say, I am the one who knows and you need to jump through. It's about know, it's about, about hey i've got something that i'm going to offer you and you can choose to take that story or you can choose not to take that story but then that's okay um and i know that um when we when we have those conversations, that space, some, because that was a conversation that my old people had, we had the ability to actually say, I'm not ready to carry that story yet. So it's really interesting. So yeah. Where does the Bāna and Gobind come from? It's an apocultural practice. Yeah, yeah. The fact that we can name it has been a gift. We've actually practiced it. But we actually, then it was a story that informed our practice. Yeah. then it was a story that informed our practice. Yeah. So it's not as if you find gold. You actually were doing things intuitively. I remember saying to someone, well, there's a show. Who do you think I am? Yeah. Yeah. And people would follow their DNA and then they'd discover, oh gosh, this is why I'm wired the way I do or why I might like woodwork or why I might love fishing. It's because I've actually had things running through my veins that I didn't understand, if that makes any sense. Yeah, yeah. understand if that makes any sense. Yeah, yeah. Is there a moment where it comes to mind where you had that Barnum and Goggin present in your life, like when you were seeking knowledge and it came, or you were gifting knowledge? Oh, again, it's out of practice. My grandfather, he was the governor who taught me here. 80% of what I know in terms of how to navigate country and from the age of, oh, eight or nine, you know. Yeah. Yeah, but I was sent to my grandfather by my father, who taught me some things to a certain point. So you learn in stages, so my grandfather took the lead role to give me the old knowledge, And then he then handed me to my uncles who honed that knowledge into a sharper, more focused thing of where to go for certain fish. So it took all of those knowledge holders to get me to shape who I was, who I am. However, and this is the however that I find, is that the Barnum Goggin story was really important because it was an old story that crystallised that practice. You know, I just thought this is why he just did it, if that makes any sense. There was enough. Yeah, but then what we learned now is that that was their cultural practice. And it's an old story that runs right across this landscape. Yeah. Which is pretty cool. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Do you want to talk about the pebble? Do I? Yeah. Yeah. We should do this. You know, I was actually thinking about this and I thought, oh, okay. These sort of conversations usually are hard to do in a sit-down space because you usually do it when you're on the mire. Yeah. So, yeah. So the Pebble story is about you know minding our footprint um so when we talk about minding our footprint we as human beings um we suffer from the fact that that we have things that tell us that our footprint has been great so things like global warming and how the environment's um trading and uh some of times it's doing well and sometimes it's not doing too well the fact that we have um you know animal species becoming extinct and we think about here in Australia where we introduce things like the cane toad and we go, oh. And if that's an indication of a pebble, you go, oh, that was a big pebble. So the story behind the pebble is actually how we enter someone else's country and grandfather would say, you know, yeah, we can have these things. Well, he wouldn't say because he didn't know about the things that we do in terms of welcoming the countries and all those sorts of things that we do, which is absolutely fantastic, don't get me wrong. But he had a very simple story because he actually said, boy, every time you walk across this space, you're going to come across somebody else's country. Every time you walk across this space, you're going to come across somebody else's country. And I did not know what they meant by that concept of country even back then. But what he says is the principle, whenever you go across and you get into a new space, first thing you do is find a little bit of water and you find yourself a pebble. You take that pebble and you might put your sweat on that pebble under your arm, but you toss that pebble into the water. And that was it. That was just the practice. And you went, oh, okay. And for years, I was just going, I just passed this paper. I didn't ask why. This was just what you did. It wasn't until a little bit later that you come across other elders and other elders would have From different story places whatever Welcome to country and in that welcome to country they would put this get a pebble and they wipe their sweat on And they would toss it in the water and I'd go oh But they sometimes it's a stone but anyway and I'd go oh But they sometimes it's a stone, but anyway. And I'd go, oh. What happens is in the quiet spaces when you're sitting on country, country then speaks to you about those stories and you reflect on it and you go, oh. And I remember thinking to myself one day, I went, why didn't you get a boulder? Why didn't you get a rock? Because when we were young, we'd throw a big-ass rock in the water, you know what I'm saying? Why was it a pebble? And as you stop and you reflect about that, I remember finding stones, and we would get the most smallest, flattest stone and as kids we'd show it. We'd do this practice but we'd show it to the heavens. And then we'd watch it go and it would just make the splash and go. And we'd go, that's a good start. And as you get older and wiser, you think about that and you go, oh, that's why he wanted a pebble. Because we've got to manage our footprint. And so, don't come to someone else's country as a rock or a boulder, but as a pebble, so that your footprint is small. But when you leave, that person says, oh, that one came, your presence is great, and there's a heart. Yeah, he came and didn't make a ripple. So he's welcome anytime. What's your dream for this site same same we look at this the boulder of this pine trees which is not our car shouldn't be in our country um why they're here well they're here because someone thought it was a bright idea to take all the old growth out of here and use that old growth timber for the mission and then replace it with the pine trees. So, yeah, we've come... We're planning to minimise that boulder and the impact of that rock and restore this country. And so down over here where you see all of these, the seedlings from the rainfalls, that's the last 10 years of growth in that creek lying down here. And so those pine trees that are... Oh, palm trees that are there, they're average between five to eight years old, and they're strong. So the country is restoring itself and regenerating itself and um and so we're not going to do a new thing we're going to figure out how we can harvest some of these seedlings and then restore this space um yeah it might not like look like all of that but It might not look like all of that, but some of it. What's your hope of this site too, is in 10 years time? In 10 years time, in 10 years time, this particular area, we hope that in the plant propagation space, that the younger leaders who come here, who, they can imagine something here. So the old folk have had a strategic plan back in 2010. My role is to create the foundations for that to operate. And now we're in that space of training education and we're having our young barn arm leaders learn from the dominant culture the that how to navigate the space but also how to what does it mean to work in the plant propagation area. And then how to think business-wise and what could that imagine it to be. So the goal will be that in this space, some of our young people from Palm will be inspired to imagine what this place might look like. And so, yeah, in 10 years' time, I don't know what will happen in 10 years time i don't know what happened 10 years time but i'll hopefully to court and release some of those banners to be a goggins of this place and they can work out what that might look like why is the um the willy wagtail important to you yeah um yeah everyone's got a story of redemption. The Wagtail is my story of redemption. I don't want to go into that part of it, except to say that the Wagtail in our culture is good news and when we hear we get bright chirping busy little busybody yeah so the wagtail for me is has been that story of being chirpy and bringing some some good news to the space. Yeah, so he's been my totem since I was a young fella. And yeah, I do, it's really interesting cause he's got the black and white colours and I resonate with him because I find myself in the space where I'm navigating these two worlds and hopefully as I do that I'm being a noisy wagtail but bringing good news into that two world conversation. good news into that two-world conversation. We were talking about noise last night, in particular music, but what are the noises that you're prioritising listening to right now? What are the sounds that are important for you to be listening to? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. The more I am in this rainforest area, the more I see the complexity of the different species and the different power regions and what each species of tree bring to give shelter to not only a bird life but also the insects and and then you know yeah just that diversity And we call them plants, don't we? It's collective, we call them plants. And I think about that often and I go, oh wow, it's a magic place, but these plants place but these plants do something where they're intuitively cooperating and engaging with one another and you know and when the breeze comes there's a little bit of give and go, you know, the sway and yeah it's just really interesting. So the space I'm occupying in terms of this Bhanam-Garga and relationship space isn't so much the knowledge holder or the one that earns, but the good oil that runs between the two entities. Yeah. And I have a sense that if we're all plants, we're all human beings, or we're all brothers and sisters, if we're all friends or whatever collective word that we could use that doesn't bring an us and them, I think we could be a pretty good rainforest at some point. And that's probably by some happy point. How can we collectively collectively be shelter to those birds of the air that are just going, I need somewhere to roost tonight. How can we potentially at some point die to oneself and regenerate into something new. And I'm not talking physically die, I don't want to die, but my ideas or my ego, whatever it is, so that I can let go and let something else flourish. I think, yeah, that's the space that I'm probably occupying right now. Yeah, that's the space that I'm probably occupying right now. And what's the... What's the Rich Cassidy story that you hope people take from being in your presence? Yeah, I've often said, and this is the small pebble story, because I've often thought about this a lot, about the small pebble, because I want to be the smallest pebble I can be, the sharpest stone, the one that has the least impact. But I often reflect about when you go back to the place where that pebble went into and you look for that pebble it's gone it's very hard to find and so i'm probably thinking that yeah my footprint would be that no one knew that i was here in the first place and that'd be pretty cool and so then what do you think your purpose is? What gets you out of it? What gets me out of it? I think it's, yeah, that when I come to a place, to come to country and I go, oh, I remember that story. I remember some friends who, you know, on the Facebook thing, they would send a shout out and they would very recently say, oh Rich, so right, Cal. Just thinking of you. And I go, ah yeah, that's good. See that's, yeah, that's the impact that you want. That's it. Any other questions? Oh my God. I don't know if that's really useful or not. I'm trying to think about this artefact of, like, you as being a knowledge holder to share with, like, organisations. Sort of picturing the artefact of, like, a bit about you, a few of these stories. Is there any other sort of like, maybe you're very humble. Yeah, so this is the one that I think will be useful in the mainstream setting. So you talked about the Barnarm Cogran thing. One of the biggest stories that we have in the Australian landscape is the story of mateship. I've often thought about this and I think about that story of Gallipoli in some ungodly place. Young men were sent to war and found themselves in difficult circumstances. But that narrative, that story is right across this landscape. You go to any town and you'll find an NJAC square or a monument that depicts that story. And we call that story now very, we don't call it Gallipoli, we call it might. You know, might, mightship. You know, you look at the football, they talk about mateship, yeah, cricket, and the principles of sacrifices and no one being left behind. We just all gravitate to it and go, oh, we understand it. So it's not as if I'm talking about something that's, when I talk about stories, that's something that's grandiose or colorful. It's the DNA of the human species. And I think if that's a starting point for you to go, oh, okay, I understand where the starting point, because I understand that story. the starting point because I understand that story. Then if we learn another story about, well, that's a story back in 1914, 18. I can't remember when it was. Sorry. But there's this other story that we've got and it's bloody old. I don't know how old it was, but it's a cool story too, you know what I'm saying? I know it's not quite mateship but it's, yeah. So maybe if we go, how can we get this story of mateship and learn that and have this older story that we've got and that's our story, my story. I don't know, I think there's something in that way then in the two brothers story no one's going to be left behind. Is that okay? And what do you think is the most common thing people come to you for knowledge is? Oh look I think everyone gets to a point I think if they're honest with themselves where they've gone down a rabbit hole they've went down a one-way street they've had to do a u-turn they've not only had to do a three-point turn it's been 16-point turn you know and when they've got out they went oh wow okay i got out of that you know yeah yeah um i can't remember what the question was what people come to you for advice for yeah so the part of them getting in the car and turning it around or what are you doing yeah yeah so i think one of the things that i have found invariably is the one principle that our people hold on to that even though we've whether he's whether he's where you've got the knowledge holding the one at the ends they all they all are invariably the same the answer is in country and you just got to look around and and find that yeah and so the most of the times the answers are thin. And more often than not, we just get tangled in our own space and we bring all of these obstacles and we go, oh, damn. So part of, I think, the role is, for me in this space, is as a navigator, is, yeah, is being a guide. I wouldn't say guide to, it's about navigating a space. And it's about having respectful conversations and it's, it's about, it is about understanding the story of the other in a way that you might not have that answer, but you go, ah, I can see you, see me see you. And it's about trying to see one in someone, but not, and to hold that other gently. And conversely, if that's switched the other way around, then I think you've got a powerful space for conversation. Yeah. Dad? Richard. Thanks, Fran. What a gift okay you got a vision you got a bit\",\n\n"

        "# Richard-our-story\n\n[00:00:00] You can't do something or give advice to someone unless you walk the walk . So I had to join those two stories together and then work out what my story was going to be. I navigate those two worlds intuitively inside almost all day, every day.\n\n**Speaker 4:** I've got this dominent culture and this cultural side and one informs each other. What the amazing thing is, though, is that I can take that model and translate and use it as a vehicle to engage not only first people, because I say to my cousin brothers or who I talk to or my colleagues or the workers under me, we've got to navigate these two worlds.\n\nBut for you to understand these two worlds, you've got to know your own world. So it is about knowing your story [00:01:00] first . The second thing, then, is that when we engage in that space, with the two worlds and the other world with the other understanding, there are people who are wanting to come into this space, and would love to be able to engage with me or my people. And I say to folks tell me your story, and I'll tell you my story, and then we'll try and figure out how my story and your story can become our story. The principle doesn't change, it's the practice, and so that's the interesting space.\n\nIt's an easier vehicle to be able to engage with conversation as human beings rather than as first people, second people, or whatever construct you want to use. Story is a good vehicle to be able to work on because everyone understands that story. That concept of story. \n\n​[00:02:00] \n"

Rather than focusing on differences, story becomes the universal language that brings people together.\nThis approach offers a thoughtful pathway for meaningful engagement across cultures - not as \"first people\" or \"second people,\" but simply as human beings with stories to share.\nWatch the full video to explore how storytelling can bridge cultural divides. #StoriesConnect #CulturalUnderstanding #SharedNarratives"

        "\"text\": \" Just click on that. Nicole, so you just have to say your full name and it's done. Natalie Friday, N-A-T-A-L-I-E-F-R-I-D-A-Y. Nicole, how long? Tell me a little bit about yourself first. OK, I'll put that down. So, I'm born in Townsville and grew up on Palm Island. I spent a lot of my formative years living on Palm. Palm is a home to me because my grandparents were sent to Palm many years ago under the Aboriginal Protection Act, so they were forcibly removed from their homelands, traditional homelands. They're from Cape York Peninsula. So they're also called Palmolena Home. I identify through my grandfather as an Eastern Googiallanji person and through my grandmother I identify as an Okla person. But I also identify as a Bulgaman woman having come and growing up in Palm. We moved from Palm when I was about 11 years old up to the homelands of my grandfather's country on Eastern Gugyalangi country so we moved up to to a little place called Wujawujal and then Cook. So I spent a lot of time with my elders up in Eastern Gugyalungi country from there and then moved back down to Townsville and spent some time in Townsville which brought about me having found my partner and then having six children. So I have three boys and three girls. Moved around a little bit, just lived on their country out in Mount Isa but also moved up to Cooktown ourselves and then we moved to Cairns. So my working experience within cultural and natural resource management began working for Bulkanoo Cape York Development Corporation in Cairns under the Working on Country Ranger Program back in 2010. So I worked for the Noonkul Rangers based up at Shipton's Flat. From there, I left and then we moved back to Townsend. I then took up a position with NQ Dry Tropics, so a lot more work within the natural resource management sector. After working at NQ Dry Tropics, I moved to North Queensland Land Council, got a bit of experience with Natal Title claims and working within the realm of Natal Title determinations and applications and prescribed body corporates. From there I moved to Palm to work for Palm Island Community Company and worked as a project coordinator under our Early Childhood Learning and Parenting and Health and Wellbeing project. for young mums and then also helping children transition from kindergarten to prep and also helping parents being the first identifiers for early childhood development especially if there was kids who were beyond or in their development mental milestones that was a really good project from then I left I actually I actually did a bit of stint with Cape York partnerships working for for Cape York leaders program where they were the Cape York partnerships had given or they do a program what they do in Cape York leaders where they offer scholarships and support provide support services for kids coming from Camp York and through boarding school so I helped there as a student support teacher based at Cathedral in Townsville for Cape York kids who were sent down there for boarding school and then I had a little break which then took me back home on Yellinger country where I worked with Jebel Binay Yellinger country where I worked with Jebel Binay Yellinger Aboriginal Corporation as a report writing consultant helping them write their annual report and putting together a reporting framework because it was a very first annual report that they did. From there I moved down and back down to Palm Island and worked for my Yuma group under the umbrella of Rainbow Gateway as a mentor on the community development planning program. So working with job seekers or those who have just been placed in jobs and helping them mentor them once they've been placed in job to help them you know pretty much retain their employment or whatever support services they need connecting them referring them being a sort of a liaison person between a newly placed participant to newly placed participant to with service providers or the employee and then I left and I worked for as an executive officer with the Pudmore and Shire Council to just an executive officer to the councillors and the mayor exclusively and that was quite a learning experience for me because it just more it was just a different legislation and just a different realm of environment for me to work in. But then I also picked up a job with the Rangers, so the Minga Minga Rangers, and left the work with the council, and so I'm now full-time with the Rangers. Amazing. Yeah. What an experience. Yeah, it's quite an experience. Yeah. What an experience. Yeah, it's quite an experience. Yeah. And today, what are we doing today? What's your connection to what's happening today? Well, being a senior ranger with the Minga Minga Ranger Program, from my understanding, the task or the project that we've done today was to take our team out with a collaborative effort with the Orpheus Island Research Centre and JCU and a diver spot out here which is a very cultural significant site to the Mungburra people but with their permission they've allowed some Boogerman people in and in the story and it's just it's a woman's dreaming site so it was was just an opportunity to capture some of the site on footage and just get down there and have a look at it visually. Amazing. And what do you feel like being here and being connected to this place? Palm Island has a lot of natural beauty, but also it has a lot of cultural values that I value a lot and I feel that are very sacred. So for me, I think that's what makes the Pomol community so strong is that there's this collaborative stewardship, environmental stewardship between the Wulgaman and the Mumbarra people. So that's why, because it's not just like, oh, they're really close and connected to the country, but it's more they actually care for the country and getting out here and they're very protective of the waters and the lands that surround Palm Island. It's a very natural beauty, yeah. I think you spoke so well about this stuff. You're going to have to get in front of that camera one day, right? No. Pretty good. What do you hope this stuff does, like in terms of us coming out here and telling this story, what do you hope is the effect of that? I just hope that first of all I'm a big advocate for traditional ecological knowledge, so just trying to get a bit of Indigenous knowledge out there and understanding that it's really in line with modern day science. So traditional science and modern day science are the same sciences, it's just a different application and a different knowledge base that's formed on it. But for me, I think for Indigenous science, the holistic science, it's not a breakup of all sciences, whereas modern science breaks up a lot of the science and it's very segmented. But I hope that with projects like this that you can capture some of the stories that are embedded within the landscape for traditional people and there's an appreciation and allows other people to not only see how like first people's perspectives, but also change some of their perceptions and how they view the environment, yeah. Rad, and last question, what's your hopes and dreams in terms of like your role in the Rangers? What do you hope to achieve? I hope to inspire the next generation to be to take a career in environmental science especially marine science and not only not only take the lead but also just be innovative and be and be be willing to make a bit of change and have a bit of passion and um i think just i think that comes with gratitude and having gratitude and having um appreciation and not only that but just um being aware and having respect for the country and the culture within it yeah so rad well done thank you Really nice to meet you. Thank you. I'm looking forward to working closer with you and seeing what we can do together. I've only just recently gone through a program with the Coral Sea Foundation and it's a Sea Women's of the Great Barrier Reef program and it just inspires women of the Great Barrier Reef to get certified training. Like I've got my scuba license now and I've got a boat license but it's also we're going out and doing marine monitoring of sites and using a lot of the data that mainstream science is used to collect and monitor and store and then use. What is that connection with modern science and traditional knowledge? It's just different tools it It's the same information. It's just... So it's the same... I think modern science collects the same information that was collected many, many years ago by First Peoples, but now they're just using different tools, instruments, and it's just presented differently. But it's the same... I think it's pretty much the same knowledge that's out there so interesting yeah amazing well thanks for sitting down are you here for like the next few days are you going i'm going to leave on friday okay what are you doing tomorrow tomorrow i'll be probably at the ranger base doing time sheets yeah actually i've got to get that in by 10 a.m. in the morning Oh cool, Rich is allowing me to stay at the range of stations so hopefully I'm not too much of a pain in the arse No, you gonna pull up a bed or something? Well yeah like Nick's coming on Friday so we'll keep with what beds like for them but until then I'll have to put on a swag or something because that's what we're here on, on the weekend. We're just going to build beds. We've got 100 beds we're going to build. Oh, wow. Yeah. It's a big event this weekend. Yeah, so we're just going to rock up with a footy car and see who wants to bed and make them up. I think I really like that Paige come along. She's only just left school. Yeah. Yeah, she's awesome. She's joined the range. She's got a lot of intimate knowledge just from being out and interacting with like the ocean. She goes out on the reef a lot. Yeah, good energy too. Yeah, but it's like for me when I do a course or when I'm doing some training or even if it's just meeting new people, I try to just do it first before the next generation comes through so then I know what sort of advice I can give the next generation in doing it. It's awesome to have local people coming through these programs and being able to be the influencers. Well I worked with the Ranger Group up on my grandfather's country and my very first project was to go in the State Archives of Queensland and repatriate all the data that was on the State Archives of Queensland and repatriate all the data that was on the State Archives. So that was a three month job of just sitting in the State Office in Cairns and just going through like boxes, archive boxes of this site, they call them little site cards, they were like yellow site cards and had like all these cultural sites that were documented. Some had photographs, some just had little pictures. Some had audio files and then it was just putting them in and scanning them and putting it onto a cultural database for elders to hold onto. Yeah, it took a while but we got it all back and then it just met off just building upon that and some of the attributes that they captured on their site card we looked at it and we thought no we could capture more data. So it was going back to our elders and actually doing lots of whiteboard sessions and saying so this is what historically the state has collected in terms of cultural knowledge what are the things that we want to capture and like my elders had written down all the other things that they want to capture and it was really good who else It was really good. Who else do you reckon I should yarn with? Should I yarn with Aunty? Yeah, Aunty Peg. I think she should. She's there. Oh, she's good. Thanks so much. I made a big mess, I think. No, that's not me. Is it? No, I don't think so. I hope I did that right. It was amazing. Well done. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but there's going to be a delay.\","

        "\"text\": \" I've got sea legs so I'll be right. Sea legs, cool. How do you buy them? Do you buy them from Barmings or something? Yeah, that's right. Actually more the BCF type stores. Oh BCF. Classic. Cool, so you just look at me, don't worry about this thing. Ready to go. So I'm just going to move it around a bit. Awesome. Yeah, so all you've got to do is say your name and spell it for me first off. So it's Jenny, J-E-N-N-I. Cool, last name? Calcraft, C-A-L-C-R-A-F-T. So Calcraft, like arts and craft. Oh, amazing. So I usually just do a little bit of like how you want to introduce yourself or like do identify a particular way or anything. So tell me a little bit about who you are and like where you're from maybe. My name is Jenny. I grew up in Brisbane, but now live and work on Orpheus or Gullbody Island. I'm the station manager at Orpheus Island Research Station, which is owned by JCU, James Cook University. And yeah, I'm a marine biologist and lover of the ocean. Amazing. Tell us a little bit about where we are and why we're here. So we're here at East Palm Island at a quite culturally significant site for the Munbarra people of Palm Island. We're here today to collect some evidence for Native Land Title and also as a storytelling opportunity. Amazing. Tell me a little bit about it then. What's the story? Well, it's not actually really my story to tell. It's for the people on this boat to tell. I'm here as a facilitator. My skill is in the water and facilitating ocean type activities so I've got my underwater camera and I suppose that my part of this story is that we have a lot of collaboration with Marneborough and involving us with this story means that we're a little bit part of it. I won't go into it too much, but essentially there's some quite large rocks here, which there's some storytelling that you'll hear a little bit more about in regards to them being three sisters. So we've got two ladies that are in the ranger the ranger group um page who just graduated and was in the at sims jcu at sims program so aboriginals and torres strait islanders and marine science and then we've also got natalie who is a senior ranger and she's a lady and then also myself who is also a ocean lady um so it was it was a little bit i think serendipitous for us to sort of come here today with such great weather um and all three of us ladies be able to get into a space which is you know women's only in in the water itself so there's quite a lot of storytelling around this which i i don't yeah i won't go into it a little bit more but that's essentially the premise of it so I've got sort of multiple programs and multiple institutions that are sort of coming together and trying to tell this story. Rich gave me a little bit of insight and there's a bit of a theme around women in water. Tell me a little bit more about that as it relates to like how you feel being part of this and what do you think? Oh yeah, a lot of us including myself are really passionate about getting women and especially Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women into marine science. I think it's really powerful to have a a woman at the research station who's the manager and we're really keen to facilitate more people sort of coming up through the ranks and stepping into these sorts of positions in some capacity whether that's in a management role or a support role, aquaculture, some sort of marine science research yeah. There's a pretty low percentage of First Nations people that go down the marine science and then even less that go down the marine science path that identifies a woman. So that's something that we really want to upskill people and sort of bring them through the ranks to go forth and increase diversity and and representation and it's really important to be able to see people's people in these roles so that you have something to aspire towards and grow towards and you you have mentors and and that's also a little bit of what we're doing today is creating these partnerships and trying to connect on sea country. So cool. How does it feel down there? What's the feel to you to be down there? It was quite warm today so it was really nice and cool to just get in the water. We had a little trouble finding the site itself and we went down and it was a bit of a swim out and we had to reset so we were already a little bit puff, which is why we needed a little bit of a break. But once we got down there and set the site up, it's pretty amazing. There's some quite significant large rocks, which represents the three sisters and that whole story. So it's really cool to see that and see how much growth there is on there. to see that and see how much growth there is on there. Saw quite a lot of fish life and different species of coral in that little space there. And there's not actually that much around, so it's pretty interesting just sort of geographically and in terms of like what's actually happened here and why is there this little pinnacle of like three quite distinct rocks just in, you know, sticking out of the water or quite close to the water yeah um last question um what um what do you hope sort of um happens um from this today like what do you hope the next stages are and anything that can be over say the one um i'd really like to see our relationship with Munbra and Boogerman on Palm Island grow more in whatever capacity they want to grow that. So that might be some more schools participating in the At Sims program and bringing these young people through that program and then you know, hopefully ending up at JCU or just pursuing further education. There's a lot of talk of this education space on Palm Island and I think it makes a lot of sense to be able to partner with an institution like JCU to be able to start to build that pathway and I think all of these sort of stakeholders are really part of that story.\","

        "\"text\": \" Alright, I'm gonna do here because I reckon that's gonna be the best eye line. Sweet! Alright, are you telling me your full name and spell it would be awesome? Peggy Pomolin. P-E-G-G-Y P-A-L-M-I-S-L-A-N-D. Cool, and you don't have to worry about this thing, you can just look at it. It's not there. Tell us a little bit about yourself thing, you can just look at it. It's not there. Tell us a little bit about yourself, maybe. You can start there. Well, I am one of the traditional owner of Pumalang, the Mumburra tribe. Yeah, I'm one of four sisters and five brothers and we've been on Palm Island most of our lives. Yeah since the day I was born you may as well say. Wow what's Palm Island mean to you? It means a lot. It means so much to us. It's our heritage, our cultural relationship with the island and all that. How did you get to be part of this program? Did you want to do it or did someone ask you? How did that work? They pushed me up. Come on, we want one. We want one old lady, no not old lady, elders, the women's side. Because we couldn't get my other sister Christine, she's a bit sick. So they asked me. That asked me, it was Alan, my nephew, he just threw a little guilty trip onto me and said, why don't you come, it's part of your heritage too. And I said, yes I will, one day, one day. But I did come along anyway and I joined up with Richard and Alan, brother Alan, very happy that I joined the rangers program. And I'm also there to help the girls and all that, you know, give them some confidence And tell them a bit of stories about my old ladies before they passed on So amazing What's um How how is how do we best tell this story of what we're doing today and especially like what's down there How do we best tell this story of what we're doing today and especially like what's down there? Like the real facility? Yeah, it's three sisters. Yeah, we all, we have a story of it. It's all about, um, there was a law over here in Brook that no one was supposed to touch a big water lily. You'd have to leave it like this. It held a lot of water. One day one girl went there and took a lily bud from there and the water spilled out. But there were three sisters out here hunting. There was no water here then, it was dry. But there were three sisters out here hunting in the water. There was no water here then, it was dry. And that's where the water came from, to make palm island. It was around Palm Island then. And they got caught in that water and they couldn't get out. They only had just a digging stick, you know. But it was too short so they got caught in the water and they drowned and then they stayed in the water and turned into stone. So this is a story for three ladies, our three sisters. Wow. How did you get to know that story yourself? What was the process for you to know? I forgot all about that until Alan had it on his phone, had the story. He said, and he said, oh, Dad, Wally, they did a booklet of our history, our story, our dream time. I said, I didn't even know that. And when I looked at it, it just dawned on me. And I said, now I remember. Now I remember when I was a little girl, that story. Yeah, some of them I remember looking through. I said, yes, I remember the story that I still remember too. That's only when I was a little girl. And when I was a teenager, I just was a rebel. I used to run around with my mates and all that. I was never worried about cultural anymore, or tradition and that, you know. But since I got back to the rangers, everything started to come back into place with me. How important do you think that is for you to be able to take that position and share this stuff? Like, what's the impact do you think that on the whole community and the younger generation? I think it would be beneficial to know where they come from, whose tribe they come from and also to respect my tribe. And some of them are related to us. Yeah. And so they know the story of Palm and they can relate it to other tribes around Australia who've been married to somebody outside of Palm Island, you know? Yeah. Awesome. I got to talk with a young girl who was born on Palm Island and just finished school and went on the Ranger program. Yeah. How does that feel to have some younger people who are interested in learning the story and sharing? It's very good. Yes. How do you think that that can happen more? Like what do we need to do to make sure that happens more often? Well, we can just ask around. There's some ladies that came up and approached me about the rangers. And I gave them all the info I can by mouth. Well, just don't talk about it. If you want to come in, come in and sort things out. Yeah. I would like to get some girls, you know, young ones like Paige and, you know, keep them out of trouble and keep them on the straight and narrow, you know, instead of alcohol and drugs and all that, you know? Yeah, instead of getting pregnant early, just to get money from the government. Just, we get them back into our community, our way of life. Yeah. What do you hope happens next? Have you got some dreams and some things you'd like to see happen on the island? Oh, not right now. We haven't come to that yet. Yeah, but I like to see a lot of young people, you know, just come back to our way of life. Going on to the wrong path of, like I said, alcohol and drugs. That's what I like to see. Yep. So important. Was there anything else you'd like to say? Anything else important that you think people need to know? No. That's good? Yeah, that's good. Amazing. I'm just going to take a quick photo. I'll take that microphone off. Oh yeah. It's got a magnet thing on it. That's... yeah! Let's see if this... oh this is good actually. That's great. How do you go on the boat? Do you like being on the boat rocking around?\","

        "\"text\": \" You're just going to say your name and spell it for me? That's it? Jess, J-E-S-S. And lastly? Smit, S-M-I-T. Cool. Tell me a little bit about yourself. How would you introduce yourself? My name's Jess and I have been in Townsville for the last 18 years. My background is teaching, I'm an educator. But in the last couple of years I've fallen into the ATSIMS program as the project officer so I work with a number of high school students and engage in marine science First Nations kids which is my area of passion and support and we bring them out to the reef and get them to see new experiences. Is this what I'm talking about? Tell us what's going on today. So today we came out to Great Palm Island and we've come out with a few different groups. We've got the Orpheus Island Station Crew. We've got a few of us ATSIMS ambassadors and staff members and our alumni. And then we've also got the Minga Minga Ranger Group and the Mumba Traditional Owners. And we've come out to a special site, a sacred site, and we're here to capture some footage and just to explore this area as well, following up with a traditional story and yeah just working together in collaboration. How does it feel to be part of this story like from what you do from a research perspective to what happens on the island like what's that sort of feel like to you? Yeah, this is really special for me. I grew, my career started here on Palm Island. So I began teaching straight out of uni here. So I've known some of these people in the team for quite a number of years and to circle back here in a different space has been absolutely incredible. And I've just been really honoured to be here and brought out to this site today and share that experience with the ladies as well, in particular. Seeing the young people come through as our ambassador as well, our alumni, and I guess sharing that with other people. And there's this thematic that everyone's been talking about which is women in water. What sort of emotions or interests does that stir up in you in terms of like what that means? Is it thematic for today, for the future? I suppose for me it's about capacity building and empowering others and that's really close to my heart. And I see that happening today, that sense of shared purpose and freedom. Being out in the water, there's nothing like it. And then being able to just explore that together as well. So yeah. That's cool. And what's next maybe for you and for the project do you think? Look there's opportunities on the horizon anyway I look. My time's not done here on Palm so I see myself coming back in a different capacity each couple of years sort of like a boomerang you can't get rid of me so I I would love to see something grow and form here for the young people. So from the school kids that I'm working with and teaching on the island right through to graduates and into the workforce because that's where our next leaders are. Good way to finish. Is that alright? Anything else that you wanted to say? That was amazing. Well done. Was that alright? Did you do that a lot? What? I did a lot of things. I did a lot of things. I did a lot of things. I did a lot of things. I did a lot of things.\","

        "\"text\": \" So, this is... Am I standing good? Yeah, amazing. Oh, maybe turn tiny bit, because you're going to speak to me. Oh, yeah. It's a great thing. Cool. Start with your full name and spell it for me. Okay, yeah. My name is Allison Paley, A-L-L-I-S-O-N, P as in Peter, A-L-E-Y. Amazing. Tell us a little, like you always start with like, where you want to start, and I guess it could be where you're from, your identity, or something like that. Okay. Yeah, so I'm American, raised and born in Washington, D.C., and I came to Australia about 20 years ago. I'm a really proud Australian citizen now, also a proud mother to Aboriginal children. I'm a marine scientist and lecturer and really, really passionate about working with young people in experiential field settings outside of the classroom. Tell us first and foremost a little bit about this relationship that you have with Palm Island and the languages or what that's like to set up here. Yeah, so at JCU, the university I work at, I'm the coordinator of a program called AT-SIMS, which stands for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in Marine Science, Marine Science Program. And we have a long history of connection with the Mumbra Elders Council and now the newly formed Minga Minga Rangers. They provide opportunity to engage with our young people when we bring them on country out to Guburi or Orpheus Island. So they're there to welcome them to their country, they're there to spend time with the young people, sharing stories, sharing advice and to participate in the activities we do in the ocean alongside them as well. Tell us a bit today what's your take on it and what do you think is special about it? So today we're visiting a site that has great cultural significance to the Mumbra people and to some of my colleagues and friends that I've worked with for a number of years. And the site has an important story that's connected with it that's part of the local people's dreaming and so we're here to see a site that they call the three sisters and it's a it's a women's site so it's only a place for women to be so we're here on a boat full of women out to visit this site and to collect some evidence of the site, photos, photography, stories that we can share and that the Mumbra people can use however they see fit. What's your take on this para storytelling, especially in the cultural context? How do you think that can be better utilized across a bunch of different families of people yeah storytelling is so important i think for being able to convey the facts about something with the emotional connection to it as well and sometimes that gets lost on paper with you or KPIs or statements. And that's the power of stories. That's the power of the visual and videos is that it can unite all of that together. And I think that's exactly the kind of education that I enjoy, too. You can teach students facts and theories, but unless you're actually showing them it physically, the two marry up so well and become so incredibly impactful. teach students facts and theories, but unless you're actually showing them it physically, you know, the two marry up so well and become so incredibly impactful. And I think that's the same with storytelling. As a non-Indigenous person, and like a connected Indigenous cultural person, what's your sort of frame of reference around the process of listening and your role in that? How do you feel about that opportunity to sit and listen? Is there a way that you go about that? Yeah, listening is a really important skill to have. It's great to be outgoing and to be extroverted, which I typically am, and to talk and to share, but it's equally as important to learn when to just sit back and listen and observe and you know my friendship with Richard and the elders has really highlighted that they always have these beautiful stories to share and I find myself as I listen to Richard constantly jotting down his sayings because the way he speaks and the way he shares his hopes and dreams and aspirations for his people is sometimes so poetic. And, yeah, I have pages, pages scrolled down of Richard's sayings. And I don't know where I would be without some of that to, like, reflect back on. Yeah, I think it's just as important as sharing who you are, which in my culture, Americans are very good at that. We're very good at sharing who we are and projecting outward. And I think that, you know, it's taken a long time to make sure I'm receiving that just the same from other people and allowing them the chance to do that. This race, Women in Water, is kind of, sounds rad and is rad. And it's like, yeah, it's a super interesting concept. What's your take on what that really means in action? I mean, I have been lucky to be a woman in water for many years now. And I have to say that when I'm on field trips where it's a woman-only team, we certainly feel, like, powerful. We feel empowered. We feel like we're in charge and running the show and we don't need anybody to do anything for us. And, you know, when you think about in the water you're thinking about boats you're thinking about tools you're thinking about other kinds of skills that may be more traditionally male aligned um and so you know being a woman in the water in that industry and you know feeling empowered and being able to share that with up-and-coming young women i think is really. It's really important too. I always like to end on a little bit of like, what's the future? What do you think the impact is? So tell us a little bit about that from today. Maybe what comes next and what your hopes and dreams connect with what's happening. What comes next from this collaboration today? 100%. Yeah. I think this has been a really important sort of starting point. We've had a long history together and a lot of us know each other and are comfortable with each other, but there's nothing like working together on a project to kind of really accelerate those connections. And, you know, this is a big piece to a puzzle that the Mumba people are working on and being able to be a part of that puzzle and help them and giving our time and supporting them in whatever ways that we can meaningfully contribute I think is going to now be its own launching point for some you know deeper connection deeper collaboration and project work moving forward for the Mumbra people, yeah, I hope that, you know, their new female rangers and their trainee female rangers are gonna, you know, stay the long course and become a huge integral part of the Indigenous Land and Sea Ranger groups and, you know, that's something that we're pushing for industry-wide is having more women on country and I know that the men in the group feel just as strongly about that as the women do, so it's really rad to be out here with all of the female power. So good. I was going to ask you another question but you answered it. Oh, okay. Well there you go.\","

My name is Paide and you spell it P-A-I-G-E. And Tanner is T-A-N-N-E-R. And Hill is H-I-L-L. Amazing. Tell us a little bit about yourself. You can go whatever direction you want, how you identify, where you're from, all that kind of stuff. I am from Palm Island and I am 18 years old and I just finished from Wuggerman Community School and I am currently at Rangers and I am loving my job at the moment. What's your connection in Palmore with your family? Um probably like I wouldn't have a clue aye. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. Tell us a little bit about what you've been doing since you left school. Um I've been working, been diving, I've been pretty much hanging around with family and friends. Yeah, and just recently went to Orpheus. Amazing. Why do you have a connection to wanting to do rangers? travelling, connecting with the AIMS program and whatnot and yeah it's just about Marines and whatnot too. Tell us about what sort of stuff you do, what have you been doing lately? So I've been on computer doing my presentation at the moment. I'm learning to be a junior ranger, trying to bring in some kids who finished from graduating and work into our ranger program and whatnot. Just volunteering and whatnot as well. Touring Palm Island about how Palmum Island, you know, like got, like, stolen generation and whatnot, yeah. Um, yeah. Tell us a little bit about what we're doing today. What's happening today? So, today I'm doing diving at the Two Sisters, um, uh, the reef. Um, I was, yeah, just snorkelling around it, sussing it out. What's a little bit about why we're doing this do you think? Why do you reckon we're out here doing this stuff today? I'm not sure. I'm trying to learn, trying to find out what happened and what not in the past. Try to bring it back and connect it together and whatnot yeah it's awesome where are the places that you get to find out about the knowledge and the story like other people to the library find ads and books you can go to at the rock painting and whatnot not as well, find that. Tell us a little bit about how it feels to be down there diving. It's beautiful, never seen a place like that with a lot of different types of species and what not. Looking at the two sisters and it's just too beautiful, I can't get over it. First time diving here, experiencing it, yeah. Why do you think it's important to tell a story about what this is and who do you think needs to hear this stuff? Our people from Palm Island need to hear what happened and how it did and how it goes and what not. And now try to bring it back and what not. Yeah. Yeah, and what do you hope to do in the future? What's your next steps? What's the next step? I want to try and get into marine biologist. If not, I want to be in the Navy, in the Air Force, mechanic as well. If not my biggest step is being a scientist. Yeah. Cool. And there's this theme of women in water. What do you think is important around having more women and especially Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women as part of being in the water and science and rangers and all that stuff? I would say to connect with it for the sisters, being in a strong culture with it and yeah, being strong for it. Awesome. And what's next for you? What's the next couple of years hold you think? What are you going to be doing? Probably stay in the ranges for a bit more and then try go ahead to be a marine biologist. Yeah. Sick! Thank you. Deadly. Smart.\","

        "That's a pretty good seed actually. Yeah. I reckon that's... Let's hope we don't run out of battery. What do you mean no battery? Are we shooting? Yeah, we're shooting. We talking? We could start. My first question. So we've been hanging out for a little bit. What's the best way for me to...\nI'll just do... What do I call you? Call me Uncle Alan. Uncle? Uncle Alan? Yeah, and then I'll just do welcoming in. Do welcoming in and then we can roll. Okay. Yeah, you can talk to me. You don't have to talk to the camera. All right. Good morning, everyone. My name is Alan Palm Island. We are here on...\nBungaman Barra, Great Palm Island, Daru Maru. We look around Great Palm, all the rest of the islands around us, surrounding islands. And we are here today, a little bit myself. Our skin name is Nakawaraka, skin name. And our language name, our language is Mulkaal.\nAnd we speak in our town that we speak our language, that we call it Nakarawaraka Purpanbara. You're welcome to Great Palm. But I say the Pukumanbara. Pukumanbara means Great Palm Island, Mambara. And Darumaru means the rest of the islands or surrounding islands.\nOr Palm, Great Palm. And today, I just wanted to say that the islands behind me, it's Ngaru, they call it Kirisho. Ngaru up there, North Palm, and Guggenbaden. And across here, we've got Guggenbaden is Hoffia's Island.\nAnd you got to cross over here to Amelia, which is Phantom Island. Great Palm is sitting on, as we got here on our emblem, is Mingna Mingna Ranges. And in this emblem, we have a...\nWhich we call a shield. We call Bukal. Bukal means shield. And we, we put, I put the designs on it as a tool because our boundary is, is come into form of a, of a big manta ray. Our boundary, we call it Mingana Mingana Ranges. Mingana Mingana. Our boundaries is that area of Great Palm Island. And in that area, we keep,\nAnd I'm just trying to welcome you all today. Thanks for coming. And you go ahead. Super powerful. Pleasure to be here with you. Yeah, we can go lots of ways with this, but I think the first thing is how would you like to talk about yourself as a person from here? And how would you like to introduce...\nWell, for myself, I got my totem. It's Kurenja. Kurenja means stingray. And that's where I got my totem because you can't eat my totem or you get sick. I said, no, I'll leave it as it is. Well, my highest...\nI've been traveling a lot around myself. As a small boy, my father taught me how to paint. And as I was starting off, he just showed me how to use a charcoal and did a drawing on a piece of paper. And then I started...\nPainting and I also learned from him also what he does. A lot of work of making buccal, making shields and making drums, island dance from when I was small and I just used to watch dad always paint and I just got to learn a lot about it and very interesting for me and me and my brother Reg, my elder brother. Reg and Walter, my elder brother. And whenever they go, I follow behind.\nAnd they'd say, no, you can't come. You've got to go back. Get back. Yeah, well, they said, all right. And they'd come back. But I always go, and I learn things from my dad. But sometimes we grow, too. And eventually, we went on a different route now and started growing up.\nWe went to schools, and Dad always been busy, so we had to learn English and maths and that. Sometimes Dad always send us to do some paintings with some elders, people. But we learned what Dad taught me too, how to paint too, and painting the shields and all that too.\nAnd for myself. Been travelling a lot when I left there from Palm and as I went to school, high schools and I did some, spread my wing out and go and travel around, looking around and checking out universities and TAFEs with arts, art colleges and all that.\nI learned a lot from that. And from that, then I sort of think that I would rather come back home now and start doing better work for Mambara now. And today now, we started our Mingna Mingna rangers up and develop. And this is how we today now.\nThanks for that for all of us. We got the Bulkerman people also with us too. And they will work with us. Thank you. Amazing. I need to say this. I got to put in a platform. But is it still running? Yeah. We cut it. Yeah. I'd love to hear a little bit about what it was like being...\nBeing young and did you have a concept of what like this place was or culture was when you were young or were you just learning? What was that experience like? Well, my experience was, like I said, to go back when I was young and that was my, that was sort of planted on me, my dad and then I grew with it, see, but...\nThat's where I grew older and we had to go to learn the basic things like the stories, dream time stories. Because me, our uncle, Rich, my dad brother, he had all the story, all the dream time stories and tell about the gobble dreaming and the sister rocks and all that.\nAnd then we had to go into, he sent us down to Uncle Bill, Uncle Bill Congo. And we went down there and he taught us how to paint in his way, see? And we learned by his way. And that's how eventually the story has started to develop as a concept of children's storybook.\nFor the people. And also we had Bill Blackley, who was also a teacher at Palm Island State School. We called it State School before, but today they call it Bullgerman School. And he used to be my teacher too, also Bill. And he also brought all the stories together and...\nAnd develop it and recreate it into a story which was created by my dad. I call it dad because it's my uncle and my father. And then that's how it all started out and sort of kept me going. And by the time when I left then I went to college, did some artworks up there.\nSort of grew on me and started using different style of artworks like using screen printing, batiks and also lino printing.\nAnd we do some bit of works on campus and then we do a lot of traveling and selling them. I was at the Cairns College of TAFE back in, I think it was 1980s, 82, 83, 1983. And then from there, it was there, then I went up to Northern Territory then and to Kasserina University and did my diploma of fine arts.\nAnd from there, I would stay there for five years. When I got my graduate diploma of fine arts, they asked for a student to go down to Melbourne, the RMIT. I went down for a student residency and worked with the students in RMIT.\nTeach them our culture through there. And what I learned from there, printing, lino prints and all that, etchings. And I stayed there until three, four, five years now. Another five years. And then as I'd done all that, I was pretty good at that and came back to Palm. I was a bit homesick, I think.\nThe weather was down, it was cold. And when I left Darwin, Northern Territory, it was hot. And then I went down to the cold area. Sort of different sort of way. And when I look at it, you know, new life.\nWhat did it feel like? Did you feel like you were always representing your culture and your place in all of those places when you were doing your art?\nLike how did you learn technique that then matched with your cultural?\nWell, yeah. Well, basically with different, with a technique like a lino print, it's just so you're not using a knife, using a brush, you're also using a pen, using a knife. Then you have to cut the material and to carve out the image that you want to put on the lino print.\nOn the lino, then you use Indian ink, then you roll it on top of it, then you put it through a press. It's like a press, you know, what a press does when they do printing for newspapers and all that. It's sort of different. This is an idea, but it goes in a different perspective, like back to front, but it goes the right way we wanted it.\nSo you have to line it up, and roll it through and then the next step you get to start, you get the first stage, you gotta use six different colors, overlay different color layers of colors, ink, Indian ink, and it's very, very good too. It keeps me going.\nWhat is it about art that made you want to do it? Was it to tell a story? Was it to represent your culture?\nWell, you know, arts always said, all this arts is coming to be something that's more creative in your mind, in your mind that you want to create something. So like wood carving, you want to make...\nCarve out a dugong on the wood. So you carve, it's how you create, how you create that image. In an art, it's a flowing thing. It's an expression. It sort of gives you the reality of what you see and what you know. And then you can sort of use the brush as you, as a...\nAs your heart and your mind take you to it and you create something. Aboriginal art, it's unique.\nAre you comfortable talking me through, you showed me an artwork at the hospital and you had a snake.\nYeah.\nAre you comfortable talking through that and what the story is?\nThe story there that when we tell the story of that, that when I done at the hospital with the Gabul dreaming, see? So it was the snake that came down from Herbert River, came all the way down and he came all the way down and he...\nAnd broke into pieces and then he came through and went up that way and landed on and came down that way to see where he came to Palm, made his way to Palm and then...\nAnd then we came to a water hole with bamboo cricks. And that snake lays there. And then the old family said, no, you can't go up there. Tell the daughters not to go up there swimming. You're not allowed to go up there swimming. But they went up and then went for a swim there.\nAnd then the snake took them all the way up. That way he ran all the way up to, going up to Mount Bentley, all the way around. And then the Gabul snake came down to, they call it, Barbara Bay. And there you got, you have Gabul Snake Creek there. And the land, it was all water, no water was there.\nCrawled all the way up to a place called Mad Daddy Garland and he went to Mad Daddy. The old man, the old father, he was a clever man too. And he trailed, he followed the tracks all the way and went all the way all over. And he came down to Gabul Snake Creek where the snake went through. Then today there, you go around there,\nAnd then you see that creek there still running. It's called the Carpacini Creek, around where Barbara Bay is, and then Osho Bay there, in between there. And it went all the way over to Magnetic. And then they found him there, found him there.\nHe asked, that Gabul snake didn’t ask him not to kill him. And he said, take the daughter, take the girl and brought her back. And he didn’t want to kill the snake, so the snake, he said, he let the snake go. And he went, grabbed the girl and went back to Palm. And the girl was sick, so the old man just healed her.\nToday and today, you see that when he go, that Gabul snake, he let him go because he went up to the Ross River and he created the Ross River and that was it. That’s the whole story connected.\nWhy did that story sort of connect you to you and why did you end up painting it? Was there a reason or was it just a feeling?\nWell, the Gabul, it’s a totem. And it’s a story connection to country, and the dreaming, and the connection with our dreamings connected to the island. The same as the creator, he created all these islands too, also.\nWhen he came then, all the way from, came across to Herbert River, he came through Herbert, came down to Herbert, created that Herbert River, then came through it, and all the way landed and came to Palm. And from there, he went over there to Magnetic, and Magnetic went straight up to and created Ross River. And the story, and it's come back again to us.\nAnd it’s connected with us too, with our dreaming, with Gabul dreaming. And it also gives us the thoughts that we’re here with Herbert River. It’s where all that area, it’s where we all come down with descendants and families. We come from up Tableland all the way down and to Palm and the connection there and all over too.\nAnd that’s why, that’s why Dad or grandfather would always say, we’re under the umbrella of the Rukurrukaba country.\nUkurukaba, this oldest big area that we cover under, we are called Kunu people. Ukurukaba means Kunu people. It’s very special. Yeah, it’s a little special. And we also associate with Banyan, Hinchinbrook Banyan.\nNowagi, over that side, Waihingum and all that area. And also come down to Rukurrukaba, Ulkuru and Bindal, all that area there. And all this connection has come under the umbrella of Rukurrukaba country. We’re all Kunu people.\nHow do new people come onto the island and understand that? Like the complexity and the simplicity of that? How do you best welcome people, I guess, in the right way, and how can people come in the right way?\nWe welcome them and sometimes we go, we take them, when they come, we take them around the way, the casement there where the story tree is. We do a smoking ceremony, we welcome them and bring them into the country so that they can also be protected from bad spirits. And let them enjoy themselves on Palm and welcome them on Great Palm itself.\nBukkuman Parah. Bukkuman Parah means Great Palm Island and welcome them all over. Everyone over Great Palm and enjoy themselves. And they go back.\nWhat’s the... I don’t know what the question is, but... Palm’s been through a journey of many things.\nYeah, Palm’s been through a lot. You get... you get... you get Benedict, like, strikes. Hundred years celebration. And... and... Bookman holidays, you know.\nAnd you also have the memories of our brother, Peter Fry, who would tell the stories of having shot curry. And that’s a respect for... that’s the story that, his stories, and it’s still celebrated today.\nAnd respected. That’s how we give them the opportunity to show their respect, and we show our respect. And that’s how we show our respect.\nHow do you think about yourself around some of the tougher times that have happened on Palm Island?\nYou think about it, and it’s part of the journey, or is it something in which, like, happened but you need to move on? Like, what’s the... how do you feel about what happened back in the time?\nSometimes I’m not too sure, you know. Life’s...\nPeople want to live in a beautiful tropical island. It’s beautiful, but the responsibility, we go back in the time, we look at it. When you go back under the Act, when you look at the old pictures, old photos, beautify that island, it’s all clean. And it’s just like that. We’ve been under the Act, see?\nWe were like prisoners, and we showed that we cleaned places up. But when the Act was gone, we were free. We can do what we like. We’ll do what we can. And the purpose is that we can’t change. We’ve got to go forward and try to develop and sometimes move on.\nAnd there’s also a time for celebration. And I don’t know. There’s some amazing things happening on Palm Island. There’s some tough things as well that people are working through.\nWhat’s some of the things that you hope will happen over the next maybe like 10 to 20 years on Palm? Are there things in which you’re hopeful about?\nI want to remember that, hopefully, that everybody be all together as one and work together and respect each other and celebrate what we can. Keep Palm... keep Palm beautiful and keep going ahead, going ahead in the future. And that’s what I look at.\nBut for myself, I like to develop something for myself and bring something. Maybe we can, because Palm's going to be around when they have tourism coming,\nPeople that we need to work in and develop, you know, business and all that on Palm. So I want to try and do something for... have a little place for where we can bring young people back into culture, learning things that are, that are vulnerable at Palm.\nI think culture is most important. People will stay focused on things that happened back there, but history...\nCan repeat itself, you know. But we got to go, we got to use every resource that our culture will go forward and keep it with our young generation coming up. And nobody with a telephone or mobile phones in this beautiful place where this whole inspiration is all around us. Everything’s here.\nSo you told me a really inspiring vision yesterday.\nYeah, I was going to bring it up one day.\nI’d love for you to...\nTalk through what that vision is.\nI was saying that I was talking about it, trying to bring it out and trying to bring it so I can explain it.\nI felt the segue was good.\nYeah, try to bring it in and try to explain it, how I’m going to do it.\nYeah.\nI was there last night. We should have talked about it.\nBut you’re going to start working, is it on?\nI’ll edit it.\nYeah.\nI can ask you specific questions about it.\nWell, I was looking at North East Bay, and I was trying to think of that I was going to do that just to make it a little camping place for young kids and kids that seek...\nI’m thinking of a word that might bring it up in a language name, but it’s \"seek and you shall find.\"\nAnd it sort of creates culture in perspective, where you can see it or believe it or you don’t. It’s up whether it’s with your heart, whether you want it to happen.\nCulture is most important. That’s why I want to create this camping, so that maybe they don’t go to school, maybe they like to, but education comes first.\nAnd also, culture brings in the... I don’t know, it’s just, it’s what I’m thinking of. I’m trying to bring it in a picture where I can make it happen, but it’s...\nSome other people help, you know, like teachers, police, or whoever can be involved with it too, you know, more creative.\nBut it’s most important—culture first. Culture.\nCan you explain like where it is and why that place is significant, do you think, for where you want it to be?\nLorde’s Bay is beautiful. It’s quiet.\nThe beach, the water, and also it has everything there. You just have your mind thinking back and start bringing people, bringing culture back into it.\nCamping, walking back, walkabout, bush walking,\nGo seek other places and story connection too, connecting and hunting and fishing. It’s all that part of culture. We get to learn to hunt, you get to feed yourself, you get to learn to say go into the store or shops.\nMaybe now I’ll try to check everything out. That’s why I wanted to start up my vision. It’s a vision I always use because it’s away from everything.\nAnd it was isolated there. You know, also comfort and quietness.\nYeah.\nAlso, you can do your paintings and all that, and art, and create, make some shields or spears or create something.\nAnd it brings you back to...\nBrings you back to reality with culture that you want to do. And it’s what you want to do to help you go forward, to help you be more a person.\nAnd what do you think that does for a young person who is currently struggling a little bit with the system and school and stuff? Why does that experience help them, do you think?\nI know I’ve been there at school. I was struggling. I learned a few, my English and mainly my maths, but it wasn’t helping much. But it’s just looking, just that you’ve got to try harder.\nPut yourself, work harder, try to, and focus on, maybe you could get some friends around the school, help you out, keep encouraging you, parents encourage you if you need it, teachers are there too, if they need it, friends there, if you need it. All they gotta do is just...\nAnd what difference do you think having strong elders to be able to talk to makes for young people? And like how do you, with a place like that, how do you...?\nCulturally, like I go back to culture and then see your Palm, you have 40 different, 40 or 30 different tribes on the island, and each of them come from a different country, see? Different places where they come, because they come under the umbrella of Bulgaman people, and they're 32 different tribes, and as a young generation, each will have to seek and find where their connections are.\nWe’re not gonna say we’re gonna send you away back up there. You’re free to go up there back to your grandfather’s country and come back. That’s how you generate yourself to be who you really are, who you’re connected to, where your connections are. And you also go there to visit your families and your relatives.\nAnd say that, oh, my grandfather’s name was there. I was back to my grandfather’s country and come back to Palm because in that way, that sort of builds you up, see? So you know who you are. Where I come from, I got my mother, my mother is a Giribau.\nShe’s up in Madagascar. Madagascar is a whole new country. My mother and grandmother, they all worked at the station. They worked at a station called Kunawara. Kunawara Station. And then we go out there, but our grandfather, my mother, my mother’s dad, grandmother, grandmother, she said that Baja Balanar changed it to...\nKirama Station, changing to Bajabala Station, which means \"two rivers meet.\" And it’s almost not far from where the Blinko Falls are. They went up there, Mount Garnet area, that side. And that’s where the Blinko Falls, that’s where Warrung Country and Guggenbaden, yeah.\nAnd that’s where my mother’s country is, up that way, Tableland. And then I come back down here where Dad’s country is Mumbara. And here we go, Boogerman Burra. Boogerman Burra is Great Palm Island and Mumbara.\nSo how long was this?\nWe’re doing good. We’re going to beat Richard.\nOh my God, I’m going to get so bummed.\nYeah, I know.\n36 minutes, all right.\nLong, isn’t it?\nYou’re so good.\nOh, now you got to break it up and make sure it comes to the old meat. I want to look at it, see where anything goes wrong. I got to make sure.\nOh, yeah. That’s the best part.\nWe need to, we need to, we need to, we got to correct it first.\nI didn’t want to.\nYeah.\nWhat do you think young fellas’ journey through this life is like? I don’t know if it’s expectation or there’s something around understanding your culture, but then they’ve got this other world, this Western-type construct that they need to work out.\nHow do they do that? Like, is that something that... Do you think that’s why some young people are struggling so much?\nYeah. When you have these sort of things like, you know, back in the old days, we used to go walk up and look around for fruit, you know, look around for cherry trees and plums and all that, back in those days.\nWe used to go down the jetty, get some oysters. Then at the beachside, get some oysters. These were the good times back in those days.\nAnd we, you know, we walk about, we free walkabout and then take our spear, go spearfishing, go fishing, you know, around the bay and all that.\nBut the next generation, when the time, it’s all been changed because they lack, lack of this because of mobile phones are coming around and...\nAmericanized and they talking like American, as the gangsters, and talking like, and I said, oh, you’re not American, you’re bloody Aboriginal.\nWhere’s you?\nYou get mobile phones and you get all kinds of things. You get scooters, you get things that are made today, but back in our days...\nAll we had was a little foot. We walked around like we used to always do.\nBut now these days, it’s slowly, but sometimes we have to try and change, but it’s not.\nSometimes also religion plays a game in all our life too. Religion, churches. But church is good. It helps. I’m not religious, but I’m a Christian. I believe in God, you know.\nBut I also wanted to show that our first priority is to believe the way what we believe, you know. Either you want to be what you want to be. You know, we make our choices.\nBut then again, we’ve got cultural perspective too, and it might combine, but, you know...\nWe use it as what God has shown us to use it the right way. And not to kill one another. And, you know, we live as a peaceful people.\nBut I’m talking about back in the time, see, when we were all, when we had this freedom of going hunting...\nGet some cherry trees or get some plums. And guava, there was the days when we had that.\nBut now, when we go back to mobile phones and all that, we change all that. TV, telephones, even shopping used to go out there.\nWe used to go to the shop all the time and push the trolley.\nNow, it’s all that. You drive a car.\nYou can’t walk anymore, you get too used to the car, because, oh, I’m getting too lazy now. I need to drive a car.\nAnd it’s all changing.\nWe used to go out to the camping, we used to carry a little bag with blankets and all that.\nBut now you’ve got a caravan coming around and you can use a caravan.\nYou could get a tent and they could make a tent.\nWe used to make them all, a little old hut and camp underneath it.\nBut now everything’s changed, young generation.\nBut it also, protections, that’s all it needs, your protection and your health.\nWhat do you think’s going to change?\nI’d rather be back there, but now you’ve got to go forward now and make the best of it.\nBut still believe in what you can do for the young generation.\nFirst thing first.\nMake sure they get back, first priority is their culture first.\nAnd maybe they can...\nSit down and talk about what they do. You could use your mobile phone, but put it away.\nThen you can come and we’ll go walkabout, camp, and bring your mobile phone along, take photos of what we’re doing, see?\nYou create something. And sharing with culture, what you can create your mobile phone to do. And make sure that you sort of keep a continuation of history, of what you’ve been doing. And people say, oh, this is Bush Tucker. Take a photo. And that keeps it in there. It’s like your memory.\nThere are some kids that end up getting caught up in this. There’s a system called youth justice or youth detention. Is there an alternative to that that you can offer in the Palm Island community that helps those young people to change and understand how to live without committing crime or getting in trouble? Or do they have to go to prison?\nWell, things are going out of line sometimes, you know. We try our best. But focus back on the parents. Parents have a responsibility. And also, kids can do all kinds of things the wrong way.\nJust growing up, you know. Growing up. That’s all it is. Growing up too fast. Not slowing them down. Meet them on the right track. Make sure they go where they...\nExpect to be, not expect to be, to go where you want them to go. But it’s all about... I don’t know how you could put it. I haven’t got a kid of my own, but I just got my nephews and my niece and grandchildren.\nWould be my brothers and sisters. And try to keep them in the right direction and make sure they stay on that. And also mainly because when you go back in the old ways, you’ve got to have that respect. Family respect. You respect your elders. You respect your elders and you respect...\nYou respect your mother, you respect your father, you respect your brother, and also the families around you. The most important is your elders. You must respect your elders.\nBack in the old days, if you don’t listen, listen and hear, listen to what they say, you get a clip over the ears. You do the wrong thing, you get a clip over the ears.\nBut nowadays, kids can do what they like now. But even it’s up to ourselves, we can make a change, we can change it. We can use every resource that brings them...\nBring that respect back into the families, bring it back into the kids and all that. Your elders come first.\nYeah.\nIf over the next few years Palm Island starts to develop tourism as well...\nThe gentleman, he’s seen us out here. He’s checking us out.\nYeah, he was standing there looking.\nWas he?\nYeah.\nHe said, what are you doing here?\nNo way I’m getting out of here. There’s someone down there.\nSure.\nYeah, we just got a visit over the horse. He got up and just came and visited us. He wanted to join in the interview.\nSorry about that.\nIf Palm Island in the next five or ten years starts to develop tourism and more people start to come, what would you hope that they take away or that they...\nFeel when they’re here? What are the things that you think are most important for them?\nWell, it’s most important that Palm can give, what Palm can provide, and Palm can produce. Tourism can be the opportunity for themselves to develop themselves and become a...\nWhatever they expect it to be. You know, like more money, more work. We have more people working, more Wulgurukaba people, more people working together to develop something. And when tourists come, they want to see culture.\nIt’s the first priority. They want to see what Palm can produce, what Palm can have. Say, maybe we can have a dancing group. Maybe we can have a camping group.\nMaybe we can have tourism for looking at the Mingna Mingna Ranges to develop the tourist brand all over, everywhere, and touring up the hill. Mingna Mingna Ranges can control the sea and the land also.\nAnd also mainly to come back to respect the traditional owners and also the people here too, also respected as the Wulgurukaba people. And Mambara also to be a first priority.\nAnd we wanted to go forward and bring everybody forward with us, work together.\nCan you see the bay down here if you walk up there or not?\nUp here?\nYeah.\nWe can walk up.\nCan you see it?\nYeah.\nOh, my leg. I’m going to jump on that horseback.\nOh, get up.\n\n"

      "Bio": "Uncle Alan Palm Island is a Traditional Owner Director for the Manbarra people and accomplished artist whose life bridges ancient cultural knowledge with contemporary artistic expression. With the skin name Nakawaraka and totem Kurenja (stingray), Uncle Alan learned traditional arts from his father before pursuing formal education at Cairns TAFE, Katherine University, and RMIT Melbourne, where he earned graduate qualifications in fine arts while teaching Aboriginal culture to students. A master storyteller particularly known for the Gabul (snake) dreaming story that connects Palm Island to the broader Wulgurukaba country, he currently leads the Mingna Mingna Rangers and holds a powerful vision for establishing a cultural camping site at North East Bay where young people can reconnect with traditional ways of living. His philosophy of \"culture first\" emphasizes that before youth can navigate contemporary challenges, they must understand their identity through connection to country, traditional practices, and respect for elders, while his approach to future tourism development prioritizes cultural authenticity and traditional owner rights.\n",

When you coming from the,\n\nyou see him when you come in from the airport. Tell me about him.\n\nI'll tell you about my mum pants. Yeah. Oh, sorry about this. It's all right. Take your time.\n\nYou take a photo of him? Yep. Yeah. I took two photos of him in the mirror, had all the photos that picked him.\n\nAh, so good. Oh, I went across. There we go. [00:01:00] Cool.\n\nWhere do I start? Start with your name. So if you can say your full name and then spell it, that would be the best place to start.\n\nOkay. You on? Yeah. Yeah. Hi everyone. My name is Iris. I'm a for foot. My parents were born here, Norman America for Foot. Eh, dad is from Bowan, the BI area, and. And mom. My grandmother, Audrey, she was from ow. My dad her father was from Maribo, Chileo area. They were moved to Palm and my mom met my dad in 19, 19 35.\n\nI think they would've met up together and. [00:02:00] 39. Oh, sorry. My mom and dad my mom was born in 1939. They were sent she was born here. This is where she was she went with different family, like families rna, the Maca boy family, she had a lot of friends, my mom, but she was put in the dormitory because her mom had other children.\n\nBut the real memory I've got of my parents together, they had, they got married and a IM church and in 19 1959. 1960. Of course, I came along. Then my sister Ivy, Diane, and Norman. We lived in an area called bottom end. Then we were moved up into another area to stick with the tribes.\n\nI believe my grandfather's wife was from out west, a Ative [00:03:00] lady. Yeah. And anyway we moved back down to the other end of the island. My mom and dad had no way of feeding us, my father to find ways to, to feed my sister, myself, my sisters, and myself. So they. I love the story about them.\n\nMy dad built a boat and the little boat was named Ivy May, after my other two sisters, Ivy and Diane May, and they, he, I dunno where he got the wood from, but he managed to scrap all the wood up to just to make this little boat and made the paddles. He made a wamp and he had spears and they rode to. To Possum Island.\n\nThey did it like monthly, every month. She would hunt for turtle at night and they'd sleep [00:04:00] over there and catch the tide coming back. And we'd all wait on the beach getting happy 'cause we had food, turtle and fish and possum, whatever they can gather over there. We came, yeah, they came home with the tail.\n\nThey'll cut it up in front of, on the beach in front of other families and they'd share it. My dad would share it or sell aate for a dollar, $5. But he was a good cook. He knew how to cook a rice, cook it down. But there were main important things that they, that we had to eat fish. Rice was filling and the damper was filling.\n\nThere was no bread back then. And he made spears. But one year it was one we went, we moved back up to the other end of the island. 'cause we had a, we went into our new home and we had to go away for school, but then the canteen was open and. [00:05:00] My mom and dad was drinking. They fell in a trap where, and us kids used to ran, run away with our grandmother.\n\nAudrey I, one the fondest memory, and I always think about it, how did they get to, to make a boat and to make those paddle and the, the tools to catch our food, the food, the turtle, and the fish and row and the exercise my mom had to row too as well. She's only a small woman and when they bought the food back, it fed us and we was happy and content with it.\n\nWith that. Until the canteen was open, I spoke about the canteen. They fell in that trap and we were, my mom and dad really wanted us to go to school, so they'd sent us out to a place in South Townsville. It was called a around [00:06:00] house. I went there, I enjoyed it, but my education level was so low that the sisters there put me back to grade six.\n\nGrade seven to catch up. I stayed there and done grade 12 and Mar 10 and Margaret Mary. I was happy with that. My other two sisters dropped out. They did come out but caused the low level of education that we had. They couldn't go further. I got that extra support but I never thought much of it.\n\nIt was education and I stayed doing my own thing for two years. Then I had my children,\n\nbut\n\nI felt that it was a relationship where I had the kids without the father. Anyway, I went on to. To working at the school 'cause I had lower self-esteem and I was invited to go to the school, do some reading [00:07:00] with the kids, which helped me with my level of reading so I could start from there up and learn more.\n\nI stayed there for five years, I think, and teacher aid that promoted me to teacher aid and I loved that job. It was, help discipline the kid and remind them that education is really important. Then my partner then we had been going to church. I thought, oh, we gotta do it right by God and get married.\n\nSo we did, but he died of cancer, so it left me as a widow with the kids. I moved from the school 'cause I couldn't, I just moved and went to the women's shelter. I helped women who were struggling with domestic family violence and single women who were struggling in their lives. I stayed there for six years.\n\nI had time to, [00:08:00] then it closed 'cause by then. \n\n\n## Transition and New Beginnings\n\nNew organization came in and took control of it. So I was left out for a couple of years. I didn't work. \n\n\n## Meeting My Partner and Career Shift\n\nI met my now partner. We, there was a job going at the rehab, so we took that advantage and he drove the bus and became a case worker here.\n\n\n## Current Role and Reflections\n\nAt thirties and knowing that alcohol and drug affecting our kids, I stayed in December. I've celebrated my 13 years here, which I'm really happy I did. With the take of the new company now, I feel it's still important to stay open in regards to drug and alcohol and other drugs as well. My age now is 65, probably 65 this year.\n\nI think I done my share in this community. I find my children are all [00:09:00] respectful. There's one of them that's in and outta jail, but he'll come around. And my daughters, I've always reminded them, don't rob your children of schooling. Make sure you send 'em to school every day. Education is important and their health and wellbeing is too.\n\nMy mom, we're waiting to move into our new home now at bottom end, and all she wants to do is go out camping just to laying on the beach and fishing. So I'm looking forward to that. We've leased some land at the other end of the island and we are gonna we're currently. And I ask someone to build these camps up and it'll be my camp, my children camp.\n\nAnd they're gonna learn the skills of living out there in the bush, living off the land. Back then we only had that one boat. We walked, so walked right down there. It was fun. We was in our team on matter back then. [00:10:00] Now. It's, you gotta get a boat here and a boat there, and boat everywhere. But I'm in no condition to walk either my mom yeah.\n\nI'm currently now stationed at thirties. I love it here. I love being around the people. I know our, we got one aim and goal is to help our people who are struggling. With alcohol, drug and other issues wellbeing. Yeah. And thank you. Amazing. Thank you for listening. Can you tell me about your lineage, your family you were talking about before?\n\nHow does, what's order, does that go in your family? My mom, she lost a son and was traumatized by it. And then. I come along in the sixties and I think I was a little perfect kid then to my parents. Then there's another my sister come along, Ivy and my other sister Diane. [00:11:00] And then my brother and my other sister.\n\nSo I'm the eldest of my, my family, my entire family, my mom's family the Alice in our clan group. I feel mom will respect me. It goes to a, I have to respect them too and understand them too like they do respect me. But. Yeah, that's me. What's where I stand in my family. And how many kids and grandkids do you have?\n\nI have seven, seven children. Pretty sure it's 2023. 23. 23 grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren. Yeah. It's good to remember those. Yeah. Do you remember all their names? No. We had a, we, when we went [00:12:00] to top end of Liv, we was like, I was kissing my mom. We need to have a Christmas dinner or Christmas breakfast.\n\nMom might be here next year. Then we have another one, then another one. But we're going back in our home and we'll probably have another one. A nice gathering together. Yeah. Yeah. What is it that about Palm Island that's special for you? Is it just because you are connected here or is it something about the place now or special because it's home, it's nowhere.\n\nThere's no place like home. Sometime I wish I could travel. But that's not me. It's a\n\nI would've traveled when I was in my thirties, forties, but no special Parmesan. And I don't think I ever lived. Yeah, I might for you a few weeks, but. Yeah. What do you think about the future of Palm Island? Are you confident in that it's gonna have a good future or are you worried where's [00:13:00] your head up with that?\n\nWith the future? I believe today's generation, we have to educate the kids. We have to make sure they go to school. We need to make sure they're in a safe environment away from the alcohol and drug away from abuse. So they can learn when they're at school. Yeah, it's important that it's important that the kids go to school, even my children and their children make sure they go to school and have a safe environment at home that they can come out to.\n\nYeah. What do you think your mom would say about the future of Palm Island and the current stuff? Does she ever talk about what she thinks about the future? Oh, I didn't do that when I was young. I done this. I had to do that, and yeah. Yeah, she'll compare sometimes. Yeah. Especially with in regards to alcohol and drugs.\n\nAnd how does it work with getting a lease on Palm Island and doing that stuff? Is that simple or is that hard? Oh, we went and got, you allowed to go and fill a paper up at the council office [00:14:00] and say, you want this piece? And they put up on the billboard and people don't, if people dispute our they'll say so.\n\nBut nothing's been said with the place I'm leasing at the moment. And is it a transaction with money? Is that how it works? Yes. I have to, once I get the camp up, I'll do that and hopefully they'll keep a record of what's been done so my children can pay that amount to keep up the lease. Yeah.\n\nWhat sort of a sort of place do you think you will build there? What sort of just a camp. I think we can have a camp at that area, but that if the lease is there say another 20 years. When they do fix the road up where we're going that spot is just beautiful. The lease is there will whether my kids or grandchildren are obligated to, and the lease, they, I know I'm open, but I gotta go and talk to em, empower the myself and in regards to land.\n\nYeah. What sort of [00:15:00] structures do you think you'll building? Will you build them or other people or? I had in mind, I've already got the kitchen up sort of thing. And three little rooms, a camping area and a veranda and a place where you can, and you can put your tents near the fireplace and we're looking out to certain areas and we'll have a better history of the certain areas.\n\nI'm hoping schools will go and use it. 'cause it's nice, it's dangerous. There's current there, but my kids know not to go to a certain area where it's, yeah. They only used it a couple of times, so once it's billed, maybe we can use it. And how do you get there, there now? Do you need I've got a boat and I've got a couple boats I found, we've gotta transport behind timber and whatnot. Needed there? Yeah. I'm looking how far is on the boat from the port? It's [00:16:00] right down the end of that island. Oh, okay. Right down there. At the end of the point, my family, my mom's family lived there. Oh, awesome. And yeah, they lived there for some times.\n\nTheir uncles and their mom used to go to then camp as well, yeah, A better history and the family that's there using it, they know my mom. See. And the history of the place itself. How many people do you think have leases and camps in different parts? I don't know. I've seen a lot on the billboard.\n\nThey even there's family that leased on in Possum Island. I think the family here at least. The other island. That island across the family. Yeah. Yeah. And what's it like when you go there? What do, what's the activities? Is it a lot of what do you do when you go there? Where do I go? Where, when you go to your Lees, where, what do you do?\n\nThe kids, we line them up all on the beach and they just play all day. But they're all row now. I'm trying to get that fo [00:17:00] where they're all laying on the beach to show 'em and put it up in the camp. This is here. This is a you here and some sense of ownership around that little area that we've leased.\n\nYeah. I was talking to Uncle Alan. He wants to put a camp over the young kids. I think it's over this way that he might have access to Northeast Bay. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. And what's have you got any hopes and dreams for what this birdies can become in the future? Are you hoping other people can come stay here in the future, or?\n\nI hope they turn it into a residential area where you see it for a few years and we'll still operate care for run programs for people who what you call it, in that boundary. We got problem with alcohol and drugs and they're all here. Our people are here who are struggling to break that chain, that bonded that's there.\n\nAnd no way I [00:18:00] known how to get help from, for it. I believe this was the elder's dream to help people who struggle with Yeah. With alcohol and drugs. To become a better person. Now there's more out there, but we're gonna understand that transgenerational trauma. Yeah. And this generation of changes has changed so much.\n\nPalm Island. And then people wanna, if you need to recover, you wanna get help, you need to get help for yourself. Yeah. You were saying a about the church before. Do you go to church? That is that Yeah. My mom and I went to church up there, a IM church and my mom shared with the group from Melbourne.\n\nShe said to them, I got married in that church over here. Yep. Yes, she got married in the church and uncle Frank. Was in the same classes there, so there's hardly any elder [00:19:00] elders left. Uncle Frank lives near Uncle Allen down there. Yeah. Yeah. We were supposed to go back to church 'cause little sentiment value we looked at in the knowledge center there was this photo we looked at.\n\nYeah. My mom was in that photo they had gathering in the yard. And outage in the yard and other thing, pray, praise and worship in the yard. So I think is sentiment of values to the church, not just for the marriage, but we were regular. Church goes back then, we had no choice in our grandfather. Always went to church.\n\nYeah. Do you, what do you think about the history of Palm Island in terms of. Do you think about some of the negative stuff that happened in the history as well, or do you try not to think about it too much? During my time and learning about it and in a lot of training that we went through the kids gotta understand what the elders that went through that, [00:20:00] what they went through, and I think finding their history and where they come from.\n\nWould help. Or even if you know your own tribe, you know your own family. I think that laia too, to have a sense of who am I? Who am I? Where did I come, where did my grandparents come from?\n\nAnything we didn't get to talk about that you? 'cause I think one thing we'll I'd love to do is work out, I think I'm gonna come back on the 2nd of June in two weeks. And I'd love to find out who in your family would like to have a conversation that could connect up with your conversation.\n\nThink your mom and happy use. Yeah, my mom, she'd be happy to sit down with you. She's she's been through a lot and we can do it super simple and in a real complic way. Yeah, you can, we can [00:21:00] go home. We help home and sit down and yarn, take the boat out to the lease.\n\nYeah. Yeah, my mom. All right. I think she'll like to sit with you. Yeah. If I'm present there and my partner. Yeah. And what's your partner's name? Sorry? Clay. Clay. Clay. And how long you been with Clay? Oh, it's been a while now. 2010. So we turned 50 together and we turned 60 together and we're probably, we're turning 25 65 together.\n\nThat's great. Yeah. That's awesome. Cole, I'm just gonna take a couple of photos. Oh, I'm not gonna be a model now.\n"

      "Bio": "Iris Forfoot is a 65-year-old Palm Island elder and community worker whose life embodies resilience and service. Born in the 1960s as the eldest child of Norman America Forfoot and his wife, Iris grew up hearing stories of her parents' resourcefulness—including her father building a boat named \"Ivy May\" to hunt for food on Possum Island. Despite early educational challenges, she dedicated over 20 years to community service as a teacher aide, women's shelter worker, and rehabilitation counselor. Now a mother of seven, grandmother to 23, and great-grandmother to three, Iris continues her healing work while developing a family camping area on traditional land where future generations can learn to live off the land, bridging ancient knowledge with contemporary community needs.\n",

So all we need, do your full name and spell your name for me. Okay. So you go your full name and spell it. Just Irene Naja n for L-E-A-L-L-A-J-A-R. And I'm a junior. My mother's a senior.\n\nTell me a little bit about Arnie started with her family. Do you wanna start there about who your family is and where you Oh, sister Alice. Yeah. She's like a cousin. She's my cousin. Yeah. She's my big sister and we've been down here like almost 13, 14, yeah. Years. So we was here with PD for a long time.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Tell me what's tell me a bit about where you are from and a little bit about your broader fam, your bigger family. Oh I got my mom and dad. My dad died almost like 30, 35 years now, but [00:01:00] my dad, yeah. And my mom, my dad's, he born in bred Palm Island, so he's Dallas at so many families.\n\nAnd my mum is from, she born Mount Isa. My mom was a NEMA before she got married to Anja, my father, so she she's from at West. She born Mount Isa mom and she traveled some when she was younger there. She was traveled throughout the Northern Territory. Then she met my dad and they got married here.\n\nWow. Yeah. Awesome. Tell me a bit about what, how you feel about Palm Island. What's your feeling about it? Do you like it at Palm Island? Yeah, Palm Island is a beautiful home and it's home of the Boman people, the 40 tribes when they first came here. During the time when travel were sent here to the stolen generation.[00:02:00] \n\nYep. And what's changed over that time since you've been here, and how have you felt during those changes in I see a lot of changes throughout the years 'cause I'm a 1960 baby, so Yeah. I'm 58 years old now and I grew up on Palm. My five brothers and four sisters, they are they people they born Palm Island.\n\nBut I was born in Townsville, so just like back in 60, in the sixties. So we were, some of us was born pre, on the mainland and not really, but Palm Island is a beautiful home. Even today I seen so many different things over the years that changes. So yeah, this is the next generation. Yeah, and I.\n\nI brought up in a like I grew up Palm Island. I come from a family of hunters [00:03:00] and my dad is a, he's a fisherman and a bush walker. He walked along here. My dad is the oldest out of 15 in the old family. So my dad was born Palm Island too. Amazing. Born and bred, like all his siblings, cousins. What, what do you think is special about the activities and things you can do? Arnie was talking about her lease and where she does and fishing and hanging out and stuff. What's the special activities that you like to do on the island that make you most happy? I grew up knowing that I come a family, I come from a family of hunters.\n\nAnd fishermen and when we were small, we used to always, activities was to go camping and learn off the land and how to survive. And grew up with mother, my brothers and sisters. So I. And cousins. So we actually come from a big family, but we come as family, always big family [00:04:00] and everything. So yeah, even if we feel second cousin, but we always know each other as brothers and sisters.\n\nAnd I grew up with so many of my cousins siblings and yeah. But main thing about pama, we grew up in a. At the time growing up, we had everything. We had our elders, more elders and older people that lived during the time of the 70 eighties and nineties and 2000 year 2000 right up to now that some of our old elders and our people passed on.\n\nSo it's up to us now as older ones to steer this generation or young generation. So cool. What's some of the more negative things that maybe happen on Palm Island that you're hoping will change? Be? Pardon? What's some of the more negative things that might happen on Palm Island that you're hoping changes in the future?\n\nNot really. It's about how you grew up in, [00:05:00] in the home environment and how you grew up. Your your parents are your first teachers. I can always say growing up and at this time of this generation is, don't really need to say, like any on the mainstream too through alcohol and drugs and see the different things now, what's happening today.\n\nSo we likable to spread out the words, that spread out. Get more to mental health training workers, get young people to steer the way today because they are the next generation. And what do you hope that Furies can do to help people that are IES\n\ncan help more and to voicing out our opinions of drugs and alcohol and the workers and many more on the mainstream. So I. Yeah, it's the [00:06:00] more, I think mental health workers that we need younger ones to steer away. So it's really the problems. It's not like Palm Island problem, it's throughout the world and throughout the mainstream and other communities, but we've got other community that cares and shares and cares for our young people today.\n\nAnd true, I believe that needing more help.\n\nWhat's your who are the people you hang out with most in Palm Island? Big one. Who are the people you spend most time with in Palm Island? Is it work or at home, or family or children? What, who do you spend with? Like I said, family is everything, so yeah. Family more at home, more during the, environment to be clear towards their young people today and.\n\nMore into, but a lot of young people today love their families and [00:07:00] I don't really like, yeah. To see more of young people getting involved in a lot of things. Like work training, more training for people today, young people to encourage them. That is life after. Education and more education in life totally.\n\nWhat do you hope for the next generation of young people that are coming through Farm Island? Are there things you hope that they do better or more of? Or what's, what do you think to do better? Finish school education. Even though when you finish school, there's more education after that and a lot more to young people today to be educated about alcohol and drugs and yeah.\n\nThat's cool. Is there anything we didn't get to [00:08:00] talk about that you want to make sure you talk about now? Or, no, just, that's all I just wanted to share about. More things to come for our people today and more jobs in our communities and not only that, like us, the older ones, we grew up in Christianity too, and that's important that Christianity.\n\nAnd what's that community like on Palm Oil and the Christian community? Is it. Big or small or, and do people go to church a lot? What's that like? I'll just say not I alone, but in between. But yeah, just more leadership in young people today and getting young people to be trained in areas and to start off small, but everything eventually will get big.\n\nAnd [00:09:00] there's a lot of services in the community and through mental health. Workers training. So some of us at 30 s we did our mental health training here. Now we're doing counselor training now. But yeah,\n\nlife on Palm Island is always, never get bored. There's people go camping and fishing, hunting. Like we did in our time growing up, going back 30, 40 years ago, 50 years ago. So not much. Older people now and our elders, but our love and respect go to our elders, our people, no past, present, future.\n\nAnd get young people to encourage 'em more, to [00:10:00] get up there and they can do whatever they can put their mind to. It\n\nis a beautiful home. This is a island home. Got so many memories of Palm and now that. The older one, young one's passing on. So got Sister Iris down here that, yeah, she helps a lot with us. She's one of the Elder the senior workers here, and she give us a lot of support and lot encouragement and give us wise words.\n\nSo just, and there's many works in the community. That they can encourage, all younger ones too. To be up there and get strong and\n\ncome away from alcohol and drugs today. [00:11:00] It's amazing. You did such a good job. Pardon? I can't wait to show you. Yeah.\n"

      "Bio": "Irene Leallajar (Junior) represents the strength of the Bwgcolman people as a 58-year-old community mental health worker born in Townsville but raised on Palm Island. Her family story spans Queensland's Indigenous experience—her late father was born and bred on Palm Island as the eldest of 15 siblings, while her mother came from Mount Isa and traveled the Northern Territory before making Palm Island home. Raised in a family of hunters and fishermen who taught her to live off the land, Irene has spent 13+ years in community services alongside her cousin Alice, completing mental health training and pursuing counselor qualifications. She sees herself as a bridge between elders who survived government control and young people who represent Palm Island's future, working to address substance abuse and mental health challenges while maintaining that \"family is everything\" and Palm Island remains \"a beautiful home\" for the many tribes who became one people.\n",

        "# The Importance of Education and Hope\n\n[00:00:00] My age now is 65 this year.\n\nI think I done my share in this community. I find my children are all respectful. I've always reminded them, don't rob your children of schooling. Make sure you send 'em to school every day. Education is important and their health and wellbeing is too.\n\nMy mom, we're waiting to move into our new home now at bottom end, and all she wants to do is go out camping just to laying on the beach and fishing. So I'm looking forward to that. We've leased some land at the other end of the island and ask someone to build these camps up and it'll be my camp, my children camp.\n\nAnd they're gonna learn the skills of living out there in the bush, living off the land. ~~Back then we only had that one boat. We walked, so walked right down there. It was fun. We was in our team on matter back then. Now.~~\n"

        "# Henry Doyle\n\n[00:00:00] \n\n**Speaker 7:** All right, Brad, so you just look at me. Yeah. Um, and good. Cool. Just so, just, um, say your full name and spell it for me. \n\n**Speaker 8:** Uh, my name's Dule. It's uh, H-E-N-R-Y-D-L-Y-L-E. \n\n**Speaker 7:** Cool. Tell us a bit about yourself, like how you identify with Palm, that sort of stuff. \n\n**Speaker 8:** I'm a, I'm a local on Palm Island. I'm aboriginal. And I lived there since I was, after I was born.\n\n**Speaker 7:** What do you reckon about the farm? \n\n**Speaker 8:** Oh, love it. It's a good place. Beautiful. Yeah. Everyone get the chance to come in or enjoy it. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 7:** Yeah. What's the type of things that you get up to and farm Oil. \n\n**Speaker 8:** I think I get up to mostly just work and got, uh, footy training that, so I play for club at Towers, Charles Towers and I train for all blacks in Townsville.\n\nSo that's most of our [00:01:00] stuff and go out to P of YC. Run around with the teens and the kids. Yeah. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 7:** What's the sort of stuff you do here for work? \n\n**Speaker 8:** Oh, what I do for work is youth services. So I work with disengaged kids or kids who not going to school. So we, they come here and we create programs with them, or we got kids in and outta Cleveland and we help them with community service and other programs like that, or getting their license when they become of that age or boat license or whatever.\n\n**Speaker 7:** Mm-hmm. That's awesome. What's, um, what's the type of kids things the kids are going up to, to get 'em into mischief? Like, is it, is that on Palm Island or Townsville or both? Uh, \n\n**Speaker 8:** mostly Townsville. 'cause nothing really been happening over here lately. And that's a good thing, but either way it's just. They're probably just bored of whatever they're doing, and they just wanna do something proactive and not Mm.\n\nSo it is, they got under sixteens on the fifteens footy club in town. I be for J so they go in town, they play teams in there, and they [00:02:00] have games I'll be in now and them, but, mm, it's real. Keep 'em active. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 7:** Mm, sure. What was it like, um, around the time of the storm for you and for the kids? \n\n**Speaker 8:** Uh, oh, for me it, it was all right.\n\nWell, I like rainy weathers and that. I don't know about the kids. I think they was enjoying it. Those run around, but throughout the whole week it was just all raining. Then due to power outage and mostly landslides that happened. It was just, it was hectic. Mm-hmm. \n\n**Speaker 7:** Yeah. Um, what was the effect of like, um, was there much effect on the programs?\n\nSo you were running here at that time or, \n\n**Speaker 8:** yeah. It was really much effect on it since none of the P workers couldn't come to work and they didn't get anything done, so they just told us to stay on and just, we out the weather, we out the storm. \n\n**Speaker 7:** How does the community react to things like that? Like \n\n**Speaker 8:** I don't, some negative towards it, put it there, but it's just how they feel about it, I think due to them.\n\n'cause mostly people don't have cars, so they can't get [00:03:00] to where they gotta go and get food on it. Mm-hmm. And since when the power went out, most all food would've went off and that enough fridge, deep freezer and all that. \n\n**Speaker 7:** Um, are there things you think could have been done better or be prepared for better with the storm stuff?\n\nDo you think it would do alright or \n\n**Speaker 8:** probably be more prepared next time? Probably with like simple stuff like generating that canned food cupboard stuff and all that. Mm. Some people in Ireland has all that stuff and all that, but it should be pretty good to get all that stuff ready next time. \n\n**Speaker 7:** And what about communication around what was going on?\n\nDid you feel like you could understand from Palm or was there someone coordinating what was happening or just watching the news? Like what was, \n\n**Speaker 8:** uh, it was mostly on Facebook and that with the Palm Island Council page. Mm-hmm. So we just waiting five updates on that just here and there. Mm-hmm. Some updates or when power's gonna come back on and all that.\n\nSo, \n\n**Speaker 7:** and tell me more about the stuff with the kids. Like what do you, what do you guys get up to with the kids here? Oh, those are the [00:04:00] main things \n\n**Speaker 8:** we're gonna to a lot. Some we take 'em fishing or whatever they wanna do. We can go play touch foot on that. Mm. We had a, for last year for a Christmas cup that, a big footy van over here and we had a under 15 side that we put in with all the boys who don't really get to play.\n\nMm. So they really enjoyed it and we won one, one game and second game was bit of a loss, but it was all right. All the boys enjoyed it. That took home jersey and that. \n\n**Speaker 7:** Mm-hmm. That's awesome. Yeah. What's, um, what's some of the things you're hoping to do with the kids over the next little while? Like, are you, you growing the program, doing different things?\n\nWhat are some of the things you're excited about doing with the kids? \n\n**Speaker 8:** Yeah. Well, just probably they look all looking forward to playing for, again, Christmas cup time. So they asked me if we're putting a team and, and I said, yeah, we, it's just gonna be more better this time or structure wouldn't happen. I reckon it'll be good for them.\n\nMm-hmm. But. Probably most of those, they got a RISE camp coming up for of kids to go train on a farm. [00:05:00] Yep. So down a footy field to go cans to play for like different teams and that it's for be pretty good. \n\n**Speaker 7:** That's cool. And you got stuff on the next few days with kids or is it quiet? Uh, \n\n**Speaker 8:** little bit quiet, but uh, have to keep myself busy and go out and look for some of the boys who has community service.\n\nSo \n\n**Speaker 7:** yeah. What's that look like? What do you, how does that work? \n\n**Speaker 8:** Uh, as of work. So whatever hours they got, we gotta just knock 'em down. Like one hour, two hours. Mm-hmm. Whatever they gotta do, like moaning out on that, just pick on rubbish or just help 'em out. Basically work community stuff and that. Mm-hmm.\n\nYeah. \n\n**Speaker 7:** Cool. Um, so you just jump in the car and drive around, find 'em and do stuff? Is that the vibe? Or \n\n**Speaker 8:** Hopefully they're, or they're somewhere else. If not, we'll just wait till later on or probably the next day or something. Get them. \n\n**Speaker 7:** Yeah. Yeah. And are many of the kids at school or they don't, they kind of disengaged with school or, I \n\n**Speaker 8:** see most of them boys.\n\nIt was disengaged last year. They're starting to rock up the school more this year, so that's a, that's a good thing. Mm-hmm. But some [00:06:00] of 'em don't, just don't show up, but mm-hmm. We try and encourage them to go. Mm-hmm. \n\n**Speaker 7:** Um, one last question is like, what's, what do you, what. Um, what stories would you hope to see more of out of the kids?\n\nLike if we were, if you were able to tell a story to the rest of Australia or become community about what the kids were doing, what sort of a story would it be? Like, what sort of, like things would you wanna be able to say or how would, how do you think the kids would love to show up in that type of process?\n\nLike, not \n\n**Speaker 8:** sharp, just go it. Mm. I just, just encourage them the best you can and just, just be there, supportive and all that. Family's there for supportive, but it's always good to have that extra support on the side for it. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 7:** So, and if we could build anything in the world out there for the kids, what would you want to build?\n\nLike what sort of thing do you think would most help the kids at the moment? If it was a building or a activity or something like, is there something that stands out for you that, \n\n**Speaker 8:** oh well, needs [00:07:00] our program here? We just met Atub, done a, done a whole bakery shop. We turned into AUB and decided we got TVs and the couches and the PlayStations.\n\nFor kids in that to go down and enjoy yourself. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 7:** Fuck yeah. So that's, that's happening now, is it? Yes. \n\n**Speaker 8:** It should be happening this year sometime. We'll be able to up, yeah. Oh \n\n**Speaker 7:** right. And is it, is it currently being built or is it getting No, it's already \n\n**Speaker 8:** built. We just, they just cleaned it out. We got all the cages and that TV done, put it in.\n\nIt's all done up already. Cool. \n\n**Speaker 7:** Yeah. Are you gonna go down there over the next few days or \n\n**Speaker 8:** Probably. Or whenever I get the chance. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 7:** I'd love to come down and just. Do a little story about what it is, \n\n**Speaker 8:** if that's all right. That's alright. \n\n**Speaker 7:** Cool. All right. That's it. Well done. \n\n**Speaker 8:** Smashed it.\n"

        "# Goonyun Anderson\n\n[00:00:00] \n\n**Speaker 5:** All right. I think we're ready. Mm-hmm. Um, so you just have a look at me. Don't worry about these \n\n**Speaker 6:** Okay. Things here. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Yeah. Um, so all you need to do is just, just, um, say your full name and spell it for me. \n\n**Speaker 6:** Spell it. Like just the first and last name. Yep. Oh, Ian Anderson. Um, my first name, G-O-O-N-Y-U-N, Anderson, N-A-N-D-R-S-O-N.\n\n**Speaker 5:** Cool. Tell me a little bit about yourself first. \n\n**Speaker 6:** Myself. Um, well, I haven't really got asked those simple questions before. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Tell, tell us about like, where you grew up and what that was like, I guess. \n\n**Speaker 6:** Um, grew up in Townsville. Yeah. So, uh, I went to Wan High. Yeah. It wasn't really much to do, but. Uh, leaving all my friends behind when I was 16.\n\n[00:01:00] So yeah, moved straight to, um, Brisbane and went to school down there, finished down there. So it was pretty good. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Yeah. Where did you live in Brisbane? \n\n**Speaker 6:** On, on the south side. Where about? I live in, um, Ridge. Ah, cool. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Awesome. I I live in Annaly, so not too far. Oh \n\n**Speaker 6:** yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Um, and what's your connection to Palm Island?\n\n**Speaker 6:** Um, family grew up over here, so, yeah. Um, we got family over here, the, uh, yare. So, and the cool walls. Cool walls are very known. So mainly from Strati. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Cool. What's, um, what's your con like, how do you feel about Palm Island? Like, do you feel connected to it or not, or what's that like for you? I, \n\n**Speaker 6:** yeah, I feel very connected.\n\nLike even when I go fishing, you know, you just feel [00:02:00] more at home and, you know, you touch the water and the sand and whatnot. So, yeah, especially when you go hunting, it's, it's a whole different, um, scenery, you know, instead of staying up home, stuck up as other people do smoke, whatnot. So, yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Um, what's it like going to school and then coming back and that type of thing?\n\nHow does that, how it did that feel for you? Being away from home or being in different places and then coming home? Was that like, was it hard to be away or was it \n\n**Speaker 6:** When I was younger? \n\n**Speaker 5:** Yeah, at school here. \n\n**Speaker 6:** I never went to school here. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Oh, no. So what was it like at school, being away from Palm? Like, is that, was that a good experience for you?\n\nDid you miss Palm? What was that like for \n\n**Speaker 6:** you? Yeah, I did Miss Palm because most of the. Um, cousins and all that, were over here, so, yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Okay. Um, what's, what [00:03:00] are you doing at the moment for your work here at the PCYC? \n\n**Speaker 6:** Um, PCYC, I just, uh, I deal with the younger kids, so yeah. I just hand out, or not handout, sorry.\n\nI, um, just put out games and stuff for them so they can have something to do. You know, what's it like \n\n**Speaker 5:** working with the kids? Like, why do you, why do you do this stuff? \n\n**Speaker 6:** Um, I, I, to be honest, I didn't really think I would be good with kids. I was always, you know, my mind was always in the kitchen. I like hospitality.\n\nSo, um, dealing with kids is, it's all right. Like everybody has their little ups and downs, like they get on your nerves sometimes, but yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Um, tell me a bit about where you were when the floods happened. \n\n**Speaker 6:** Um, I, I was in Townsville. Um, yeah, I didn't know what was gonna hit [00:04:00] until I got stuck in there, so, yeah.\n\n**Speaker 5:** And what did you hear, I guess, like what was the experience look for like, \n\n**Speaker 6:** um, well, hearing that the boat wasn't running, so I was just like, ah. Yeah, I'm definitely stuck in here until they start running again. Yeah, it was, yeah, it was just too hectic. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Did you have any way to like, talk to anyone that was on the island and about what was happening or, \n\n**Speaker 6:** um, yeah, and no.\n\n'cause the signal was playing up over here, so I couldn't really Yeah. Do much except, um, look at the Palm Island. Council page. Yeah. Because that's how they got everybody updated with the weather and stuff. So a few power loans fell down over year, so. Mm. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Um, and what was the effect on people in your sort of family and things like that?\n\nIs there much [00:05:00] effect on their, whether living or sort of thing, \n\n**Speaker 6:** the house? Um, not really. Yeah. It was just the hard part was the connection, like. Yeah. Just, just a signal, like I said. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** And what, when did you, how long before you were able to come back here? \n\n**Speaker 6:** It was like after two weeks. Yeah.\n\nWhy? \n\n**Speaker 5:** Yeah. So why, was it two weeks or was that just 'cause of your plans or was it hard to get here or? \n\n**Speaker 6:** Um, no, uh, it wasn't hard getting here. It was just the boats and, 'cause that little ramp thing that's on the jetty mm-hmm. That was broken. So, yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** And how do you think the community handled the floods in general?\n\nLike, do you think people had, was it tough for people or did people come together and help each other? What was the general feeling? Um, \n\n**Speaker 6:** oh,[00:06:00] \n\nI'm not too sure really, but all I could think of is that everybody knows. How to live without power, so we're right. Just make a fire and we're okay. Yeah, \n\n**Speaker 5:** sure, sure. Um, how do you feel about Palm and general in terms of like, people working together? Do you think that's a common, common thing on Palm Island that people help each other or do people keep to themselves and help people close to them?\n\nWhat's the general feeling for you? Um, \n\n**Speaker 6:** a lot of people, they help each other. Um.\n\nWith anything really. Yeah, it's, it's not that hard to ask, but you know, some people they shame over, so we'll have to go to them and ask 'em if they're right. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Mm. Um, what's the general vibe of the kids over in Palm Oil and are there things to do? Do they get bored? Oh, they, \n\n**Speaker 6:** sometimes they do, they get, they [00:07:00] get bored on the weekends especially, but where there's another program as well, it's called, um, back to Bush.\n\nUm, only Lindsay is, um, taking part of that one. So are use, tell me more about that. Are interested in that? Yeah, so, um. Back to Bush. I used to work with them too as well. Um, uh, all they do is they just take their kids out hunting, fishing, and camping. They're actually camping at the moment, so Cool. Yeah, we're in a small bay.\n\nWhere \n\n**Speaker 5:** do they camp from? \n\n**Speaker 6:** We're in a small bay, so it's easier, um, to go out reef in there 'cause the tide goes right out and you can see everything. \n\n**Speaker 5:** How many kids \n\n**Speaker 6:** are out at the moment? Probably at least 20. Wow. Or less. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** That's cool. And is that through the PCYC? Is that, no, \n\n**Speaker 6:** that's different. Yeah. Is it through pick or, I'm not too sure.\n\nYeah. Cool. And \n\n**Speaker 5:** have you been [00:08:00] out on the Bush camp with the kids? \n\n**Speaker 6:** Yeah. Yeah. They love it. They love it. Yeah. The. Midnight. You know, they stay up all night, so they can't do that at home. I think that's another reason why they come out. So, yeah. Why, why do \n\n**Speaker 5:** you reckon it's important for the kids to go out, do that stuff and like, \n\n**Speaker 6:** so they can know their culture?\n\nI mean, they do. It is just, yeah. There's other things out there that they probably don't know that could kill 'em. You know, the dangerous ones. Yeah. Mm-hmm. \n\n**Speaker 5:** That's cool. Are there any other programs like that for kids in Palm Island? Is that the main one, um, \n\n**Speaker 6:** of the culture? Well, that's the main one. Yeah. Yeah, because they've taken about poss mounting too, so that's pretty good.\n\nYeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Poss mounting sounds fun. Yeah, \n\n**Speaker 6:** I haven't been, so just, I guess it's a, yeah, a lot to handle. \n\n**Speaker 5:** And what's your sort of. Have you got [00:09:00] hopes and dreams and stuff with Palm on for yourself here? Like are you, can you stay here and get to continue working here and stuff, or is there other people do? Um, \n\n**Speaker 6:** yeah, I guess so.\n\nUh, guess I'll just stay, but yeah, there's other people want me to go to experience more out there, so. Yeah. You say sorry, you \n\n**Speaker 5:** just wing it or you just \n\n**Speaker 6:** Yeah, sometimes I just go with the flow and see what options I have, so. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Um, and if there was something that we could do to represent what the floods was to Palm Island, build something, what do you think would be the best thing to do?\n\nLike if we were able to build anything that could be used anywhere on Palm Island, do you have an idea of what, what would be fun or interesting that people would like to use or a way to remember that at all? \n\n**Speaker 6:** Um. I wouldn't have a clue to be honest. [00:10:00] \n\n**Speaker 5:** What's something you wish was like in that sort of main part of town that that would be useful for people to hang out?\n\nLike would there be something that um, could be built that would be used and interesting or \n\n**Speaker 6:** like a facility or something? Yeah. When there's no power and there's one little place where everybody can go. Um, yeah. I guess to charge, uh, charge the, you know, phones and stuff and then they can go back home whenever.\n\nCool. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** And what about like a place to sit and yarn and stuff? Is that, do you reckon that would be cool? Somewhere down \n\n**Speaker 6:** the water there. Yeah, I reckon. Yeah. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** And how are people usually like to hang out with like the people up. Chairs or they sit on the ground or what's, uh, \n\n**Speaker 6:** they sit on the ground.\n\nSure. Yeah. Um, sometimes after work here, 'cause we finish at eight, um, we take the kids out on the, for Freedom Park [00:11:00] and we just make a fire and we just sit there till 12. That's cool. Yeah. And we just yell about anything really. Look at the stars or something. Some people, they bring out, uh, their fishing line and stuff, so we just throw a line out on a beach.\n\nYeah. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** So sometimes you don't really need much. It's just like people and \n\n**Speaker 6:** Yeah. Bit of fire. Yep. Pretty much. Unless someone's gonna bring a lot of snacks, which sometimes they do. So, yeah. \n\n**Speaker 5:** Cool. Well, that's it. There's anything else we didn't talk about that you, you think we should, or anything you wanted to bring up or, \n\n**Speaker 6:** um.\n\nNo, not really. Yeah. I'm good now. Thank.\n\n"

        "# Roy Prior\n\n[00:00:00]\n\n**Speaker 23:** Um, looking pretty good here. All right. You look at me. Tell about that? Yeah. All just a, a little yarn between us. Um, just, first of all, you just have to say your full name and then spell it for me so I've got that.\n\n**Speaker 24:** Okay. So it's, uh, my name's Roy Pryor, R-O-Y-P-R-I-O-R, Roy Pryor. Cool.\n\n**Speaker 23:** Uh, tell us a little bit about yourself first.\n\nRoy,\n\n**Speaker 24:** uh, born and bred on Palmer. Uh, yeah. Worked, uh, in a lot of different areas, uh, both here and also, uh, mainland. So, uh, came back, came back to Palm a few years ago to, due to my grandmother being a bit crook and, um, stayed so.\n\n**Speaker 23:** Mm-hmm. What's the stuff that you like about Palm or,\n\n**Speaker 24:** uh, well, naturally the natural beauty is [00:01:00] one thing.\n\nI mean, you know, we get up to a, an island that's, uh, less coha, uh, hectic in terms of traffic and, and stuff like that. I mean, it's, it's pretty laid back. Um, you know, uh, and a lot of my family lives here as well. I've got good friends here that I've grew up with, so, um. That's, that's pretty much, and yeah, got my own little family and, uh, grandkids as well now.\n\nSo, um, don't look like I'm going anywhere, any, anytime soon.\n\n**Speaker 23:** Tell, tell us a bit about the, the broader family. Where are they staying around here and stuff?\n\n**Speaker 24:** Uh, I've got a number of family here, but I've also got, uh, some of my family members that have left the island. Uh. With their kids' education, nieces and nephews and stuff like that, that have sort of either gone to, uh, Townsville or down in, uh, GaN staying.\n\nMy mum's down there currently right now merging with my brother. So, um, [00:02:00] yeah, so huge, huge. We've got a huge family, people in Bowen, um, and also Ingham as well. Few up in Cairns and another community up there in Yoruba. So we've got a big family. Yeah,\n\n**Speaker 23:** tell us, tell us a bit about Pick and about your sort of concept of what Pick does in community.\n\n**Speaker 24:** Oh, look, I, I came here 2011, 2012 to join pick. Um, I like the concept of, um, uh, community base and whatnot, and more to the point of assisting people on the ground. You get to deal with stuff, um, usually on a, on a day-to-day basis where you are interacting with community people. Um. But we've come a long way since then.\n\nUh, you know, about 10, 11 years ago since I've been here. Um, it's grown massively. They've un undertaken a number of additional programs and projects in the community that they, uh, [00:03:00] currently run. Now. Uh, you would've seen the health center that they've picked up and sort of, um, but the, the health and wellbeing side of it is really, uh, really great as well in terms of what we deliver on the ground and, and to the community.\n\n**Speaker 23:** Mm-hmm. What's, um, what have you seen in terms of the growth of Peak and the other things they've picked up over the way? Like what's that feeling being like as it's grown? Um,\n\n**Speaker 24:** look, probably, obviously the employment is a big thing for community people to have a full-time job. Mm. And get a decent wage at the end of it as well.\n\nI mean, providing, you know, everyone's on the same boat, so to speak, in terms of, um, delivering a lot of those services, uh, uh, to the community. Um, we tend to sort of generally have our managers meeting or, you know, once a fortnight and sort of catch up with everybody. And we interact with also a lot of other key stakeholders in the [00:04:00] community where we jump on board and help some of their activities.\n\nUm. Yeah. But, uh, we've got some really, really great staff now. Um, and it's been driven by a lot of our managers as well, um, which has been really good. I think everyone's sort of bought into the concept of what they're here for. Um, but you do see, you tend to sort of see the ones that, um, come here with the vision and then.\n\nUm, find it really hard and they leave after a couple of months. But, um, but the ones that we've sort, sort of stuck with us for the last, you know, five to six, seven years are, have been absolutely great for the, for the organization.\n\n**Speaker 23:** Mm. That's cool. Um, tell us a little bit about this, your, where you were at, um, when this flood started and what that was like for you in the beginning when, when you heard that it might have been a, a bit of a weather incident.\n\n**Speaker 24:** Uh, we're off well being at work and whatnot. We we're just [00:05:00] prepping, obviously. Um, uh, some of the service we have, we've got clients, uh, that, that are in those services. Um, also the health side of it where medication is a big thing. So, um, a lot of pre-planning with getting medications out and whatnot. But, um, yeah, been here most of my life.\n\nYou could tell when it's gonna be a pretty big storm. Uh, but this year it's, uh, we haven't seen anything like it. It was just continuous for days and nights and days and nights. Um, and, uh, my understanding and my conversation with a few community people is that, uh, there whole house was leaking, uh, including mine as well.\n\nSo yeah, had a number of, um, workers that stayed either with Cuba or uh, Poland SHI Council that were out. SES were doing tapping up and trying to secure some of the leaking in the roofs and stuff like that. So, um, [00:06:00] but yeah, it really was, I think you, you see the, um, impact when the tide's high because there's that much water coming off the dams and the spillways and the, and the creeks and the river from the mountains.\n\nIt just hits that high tide and then it just backs up. So a lot of erosions, um, road cut off. Um, I believe there was some me sea that was seated down at the radio grounds, but between that you were cut off. I think they use a, they used the, um, the firetruck, I believe to get down there. They get, you know, the paramedics to get 'em down there to sort of get the, get the, um, patients and stuff like that.\n\nSo, um, yeah, elderly affected as well. Um. A lot of mold after, which is normal up in North Queensland, you know, um, uh, pick was at the forefront, forefront of that in terms of getting supplies to the [00:07:00] community and whatnot, because you must remember also, um, we had far north Queensland absolutely isolated from Ingham to towns of the Buran charter towers.\n\nSo all your roots, you know, your stock route that bring in, um. Whether it be your groceries or your daily items that you sort of purchase at the shop was just basically cut off. Mm-hmm. You know, as far as north as, I think it was cook down as well, they were up, they got, got smashed and, and stuff like that.\n\nSo it was just a mass weather, um, front that came through that just absolutely just stayed on top of us. Yeah, you know, usually you get two or three days of full on rain and it'll, it'll just sort of either head south or go out to the oceans or out to the sea. But this storm just basically just sat on top of us.\n\nUh, you know, we had stock from Ingham that we couldn't get across, you know, um, then you had [00:08:00] power out as well for a few days, um, which isn't ideal. Um. But, you know, having kids at home and grandkids at my place, uh, you just make sure that everyone's safe and whatnot and you do the best you can. Um, and kids didn't sort of like the, the dark nighttime and whatnot, but, um, you know, um, obviously no phones and TV and stuff like that, which is was, which was great.\n\nUh, I grew up around that stuff, so, and. Probably, um, for a learning curve. I think, uh, some of the kids now they need to understand how good they've got it, you know? Uh, but, um, we had lamps and torches and stuff like candle that we usually have in our, um, in our, uh, containers that we put away for cyclone, stuff like that.\n\nSo we all just get more gear every [00:09:00] year. Just pack it up, make sure we've got stuff on hand. Mm-hmm. Um. And you just turn it into a little camp out. That's all. Everyone camps in the lounge. Bit hot. No. Can't get to sleep. But you know, that's, um, I think that's the one thing that you've gotta put up with living in the far north Queensland.\n\nMm. And it's a seasonal thing. I mean, you grow up around it, you know it's coming, um, whether it be cyclone or monsoons or\n\n**Speaker 23:** Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh, right. Um, what was the, um, the feeling of sort of supporting community? Was it every person for themselves or people like jumping and helping each other was like, what was that feeling like?\n\nI\n\n**Speaker 24:** think it's, uh, it's. People will help, you know, but then saying that there are people in the community that one put their hand up and say, you know, Hey, can someone give us a hand? And whatnot. Mm-hmm. [00:10:00] Usually family and friends or you're next door a neighbor that, you know, you get on well with, you sort of look after each other and stuff like that.\n\nThey've, you know, they're cooking scones or something and you've got no bread. You've been out food for a couple of days. People tend to share. Um, yeah. Or someone's cooked up a. You know, a big stew and rice or something and someone, Hey, you wanna bring the kids over for tea? You know, so the community value's there, um, it's just a matter of, um, how you sort of ask for help, I suppose, and, and you standing in the community.\n\nUm, a lot of our elders sort of got a bit of support around 'em from family members and a few other community members dropped in it and stuff like that. So, um, yeah.\n\n**Speaker 23:** Yeah, it's such an interesting concept. I hear that a lot of like, um, I think everyone's willing to help, but there's not a whole people willing to ask for it.\n\nMm. And so there's that known unknown, [00:11:00] um, responsibility of some people to, to, to just do that without being asked or whatever. Um,\n\n**Speaker 24:** I know it's unfortunate. It's the ones that are disengaged from the community. That don't attend any events, that don't do any volunteer work and stuff like that, so they don't have that interaction with other community member, you know?\n\nUm, and that's just the norm of it. That's a, that's a, unfortunately people are sometime mm-hmm. You're gonna get people that are willing to just sit at the back and say nothing and just either go with the crowd or you're gonna get people that sort of just get in and say, Hey, this is what we're doing.\n\nMm-hmm. You wanna jump on board? Give us a hand so that's, yeah. Mm.\n\n**Speaker 23:** Okay. What's, um, what's this idea of like, voices of the community, do you think? Are they, like, there's obviously different types of people and they say different things and there's different stories, but, um, like are there different ways in which voices are heard in community, um, that are, [00:12:00] um, almost like planned voices and some unplanned, I'm just thinking about how does, how do you know what that sort of.\n\nStay the palm is through voices, through community yarning and things. Is that something you feel that like people just talk about, like you'll know what the feeling of the island is, just ya with people like Yeah. How does that feel to you?\n\n**Speaker 24:** Yeah. Um, a lot of it is emotional as well. Um, I think that's a big, uh, sign in, in, in the sense of, uh, the stress level that, that people are at.\n\nUm, but uh, you know, you do have. Certain people in the community that have their own agendas and would sort of, I suppose, miss information would be the big thing. Screwing the narrative in terms of, um, you know, what, what council or what [00:13:00] organizations are getting out there in terms of what, what assistance being, um, run on the ground and stuff like that.\n\nBut, uh. Hmm. Yeah. And look, we're no different. You always got, you know, a bunch of people in different society or different towns that turn to sort of grandstand, oh, this is my time to grandstand. Um, when an actual fact it's not, it's a community. Hmm. Um, that needs to come together to sort of rise above, uh, some of the issues that we faced at that time.\n\nSo.\n\n**Speaker 23:** Um, we're talking with Rachel and team a lot around\n\n**Speaker 24:** just on that as well, just on that. I think social media plays a lot in that. Mm-hmm. Just, just the disinformation that was coming out on social media by certain people in the community were just absolutely garbage. Mm-hmm. And then you, you just, it's like, they call it the Eno effect where everyone just sort of piles onto it, you know, [00:14:00] they're all into it and they're all going for it, but nothing comes of it.\n\nYeah. You know what I mean? They just make all the hysteria up and jump up and down, but. And actual fact they're not contributing to what's happening on the ground. Uh, and that's a, that's sad. That's just in society and it's in general, whether it be here on Palm or any other major city in Townsville or Australia, you know?\n\nYeah.\n\n**Speaker 23:** So true. Um, yeah, I mean, talking to Rachel and the team about what this idea of like, I think annual reports can be quite boring and laborious and painful. And we've been thinking about what would it feel like to create something that is a more of a celebration of p and palm oil? What, what do you think would be in that like annual report if you were to create one that was, that you were proud of or that represented what pick was doing in the, in the island really well, like are there certain ways in which you [00:15:00] would would do that?\n\n**Speaker 24:** It's quite interesting because we, we tend to have our, um. Managers and executive meetings once a year where we all get together and for the last two or three years, um, we don't tend to sort of get the, the good news story out. Mm. You know, and it, it's always been raised like by different managers, including myself, that, you know, unfortunately community people don't know what's going on and whatnot.\n\nBut, and saying that, I think it's important. As an organization that you promote a lot of that stuff as well, that you, you let community people know that's exactly what's, you know, these are, these are the activities, or this is happening, or there's a function going on, or programs that are running. Um, uh, and we just don't promote that enough.\n\nThat's all. You know, we're sometime, we're a bit too [00:16:00] humbled by ourself for being humble, if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Just get the work done and just move on. Uh,\n\n**Speaker 23:** so it's almost like another function where you can help get that news out and Yeah, talk about it and yeah, lots of different ways. Right? Yeah.\n\nThat's cool.\n\n**Speaker 24:** Yeah.\n\n**Speaker 23:** Um, and the other one was like the, we are thinking about what is a physical artifact that can be created that is representative of after the floods or a memory or something. Is there something that you think would be. Something that's both practical and helpful and something that could be a, a memory of the floods that help community to come together or remember this staff or either something purposeful.\n\nUm, like do you think it's a space where people come together or is it more like a, um, like a book or something that you create or?\n\n**Speaker 24:** Look, I think [00:17:00] the events in our community over the last 10 to 50 years that have been significant in terms of where the community heads, I think some of those stories shouldn't be forgotten because they defined us as a community and mainly the people that have been at the forefront of, of a lot of those discussions or the activities or the programs that have been run on the in, in those, in the community.\n\nMm-hmm. That's really made an impact not only to certain individuals and whatnot, but the overall community. Um, perfect example was that when we had the COVID lockdown here, um, you know, um, a lot of, uh, a lot of our services staff and managers and whatnot, they flew off the island. So it was predominantly.\n\nUm, the pick workers that were based at home community members that drove a lot of those, um, [00:18:00] those assistant, um, I mean, in a short was just picking medications up, um, dropping food, um, boxes off, uh, to people that were in isolation that couldn't get to the store or something like that, you know? Um, uh.\n\nPopping in and making sure that people had, uh, enough medication with the elders and stuff like that. Um, 'cause taking into consideration, you had people like the disability, um, organization that were here at the time, they all left as well. So you had NDIS clients that were knocking on our door and, um, asking for help.\n\nSo, um, a lot of the community people sort of. Packed it all, packed all the food, doing a hundred boxes, 200 boxes, and then delivering. 'cause you'd get a list of people that were [00:19:00] in isolation that couldn't move. So then you'd drop around those box of food to every food parcel, to every household that was there.\n\nOr you'd get a phone call from the, the nurse or the doctor saying, Hey, you know, this family didn't pick their medication up. They're ringing in. You know, because, uh, someone needs their medication, can you come and get it? So, um, you know, we work really well. And that was like Monday to Sundays right through even with some of our staff actually, um, contracting, um, yeah, and then also being in isolation.\n\nSo, um. But those are some of the things that shouldn't be missed, you know? Um, I know when we sort of came outta lockdown, I personally went around and spoke to every one of 'em, you know, some of the staff that sort of was sitting under me, under my control and just said, Hey, [00:20:00] you know, thanks for, you know, for going outta your way.\n\nI, I know you got family at home, but, um, appreciate everything you've done and whatnot. And I said, typical combat was. Oh, that's the right brother. It's for the community. Yeah. Is it, you know, even though I've got bloody Yeah. The, the virus and whatnot, but you know, as long as everybody else is safe, you know?\n\n**Speaker 23:** Mm. I wonder how you create something that's like a memory, like archive box, voice,\n\n**Speaker 24:** um, something like that. Whether it be digital through, I mean, ideally, um. You know, people can sort of tap into it on a link or something and say, holy shit, this what happened, you know, years ago. And it's, it's in the what up uploaded or whatever they call it.\n\nYeah. You know, I'm not too savvy on that. Yeah. So, um, that would be great. Um, it'd be great to sort of capture a lot of other community people's, um, [00:21:00] comments as well on that. Mm-hmm. Um, I know it's. We just, you don't want it to be predominantly a overall pick, you know? Um, it'd be great to get sort of some community members that were involved, um, ambos, um, yeah, were involved.\n\nThe police, you know, um, yeah. Yeah. That's\n\n**Speaker 23:** awesome. Cool, mate, you smashed it,\n\n**Speaker 24:** you reckon\n\n**Speaker 23:** mate?\n"

        "# Ruby Sibley\n\n[00:00:00] \n\n**Speaker 9:** Okay, this is Super Chill. Was conversation with me. Um, so just your full name and spell your name, first of all. It'd be awesome. \n\n**Speaker 10:** Uh, it's Ruby. RUBY. \n\n**Speaker 9:** Yeah. And your last name? \n\n**Speaker 10:** Sibley. S-I-B-L-E-Y. \n\n**Speaker 9:** Cool. Tell me a little bit about yourself first. How would you explain yourself, and I guess your, how do you identify and.\n\nThat's, \n\n**Speaker 10:** I'm Aboriginal born, born on Palm, was here all my life. Yeah. Went to boarding school and had 10 kids and\n\n**Speaker 9:** big life already. \n\n**Speaker 10:** Yep. \n\n**Speaker 9:** What do you like about Palm Island, or what do you think about Palm Island? \n\n**Speaker 10:** Oh, I love Palm. It's quiet. You know, it's not, um, [00:01:00] busy like Townsville or any other way. I go to Townsville, but I don't like to stay in there that long. If I had house, I would stay in there, but always run for pump.\n\nYeah. I'm always really wanna get back to, um, \n\n**Speaker 9:** yeah. What sort of stuff do you do to relax around farm and hang out and things? \n\n**Speaker 10:** We go walk on the reef, go camping when we get to time, uh, fishing. I love our fishing reefing. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 9:** That's cool. Um, tell me a bit about the work here that you do. \n\n**Speaker 10:** Um, well, we're just, uh, go and, uh, work with the school.\n\nUm, help them go see the parents, ask why the kid's not at school, and yeah. And then pick the late ones up with. Um, Doris and Lynn, I go work with them, pick the late ones up and ask the [00:02:00] parents why they're not come to school And yeah, and start parents if they need any help or that with anything. Yeah.\n\n**Speaker 9:** Cool. What are some of the more challenging parts of the job, do you think? Like what, what's, what's something that's at hard about what you do? \n\n**Speaker 10:** Uh, it's hard because you can't really. Force parents, you know, to send their kids. Can't actually tell 'em 'cause you're not their mother. Mm. Or grandparent, you know, to really tell 'em what to do.\n\nYeah. \n\n**Speaker 9:** Um, and we're talking about the storm that was recently happened. Were you here for the storm? Yeah. What was your experience around that time of the storm? How did it feel for you? \n\n**Speaker 10:** Oh, that was, yeah, that was too ter. Well, I lived around the bay, [00:03:00] near the seaside beach and yeah, we had some trees fall down and that was terrible.\n\nI couldn't take the kids out or anything. It's too windy and rain and my yard got flooded, went for a ride. There's trees everywhere. And there was the lands first landslide down at the farm, cooked, uh, on the corner there. Doctor Point. Yeah. And we just, yeah. And yeah. Couldn't, and the flood, we, the, when you try to go down, couldn't go down to rodeo ground sometime to pick the kids up.\n\nHave to wait for the water to recede Mm, yeah. To pick 'em up and. Mostly, you know, well the parent, what if I was there? Most probably wouldn't wanna send my kids in the rain and weather and anything, you know? Yeah. Mm-hmm. But [00:04:00] yeah, it was terrible. Mm-hmm. \n\n**Speaker 9:** Um, what was the reaction of the community, do you think?\n\nLike how did the community, um, deal with some of the stuff that was happening during the flood storm? \n\n**Speaker 10:** Oh, I'm not really sure. 'cause I don't usually come in the mission. I just stay around home with my place and it, yeah. \n\n**Speaker 9:** Um, was there a long recovery for the stuff that you were doing? In terms of what \n\n**Speaker 10:** Yeah, there was, yeah.\n\nThere was long recovery, I reckon it was. \n\n**Speaker 9:** Mm-hmm. What was some of the things that needed to get fixed and, and stuff and \n\n**Speaker 10:** Yeah, like the road down there that took years on end to fix. \n\n**Speaker 11:** Mm-hmm. \n\n**Speaker 10:** Um, our road around there. Very bumpy. If you want to lose weight, you gotta just come around to my house, drive around there very fast, or, yeah, just to lose [00:05:00] weight.\n\nBut now they're doing to road it up, they finally doing to road it up for us. So, yeah. Yeah, yeah. \n\n**Speaker 9:** Um, what do you think, um, the. What do you think the story is about the storm, like in terms of what you do with the kids? Do you think that it affected the kids very much or did they learn things from it, or what do you \n\n**Speaker 10:** think?\n\nWell, I reckon it affected the kids very much because they lost school days. You know, education didn't get much at school, and yeah, I think they would've learned from this weather. Hopefully the parents told 'em about it, you know? So, yeah. \n\n**Speaker 9:** Mm-hmm. Yeah. And then we've been thinking about like, what is something that could be built or, um, some kind of memory of what that was like.\n\nIs, is there something that you think would be good to [00:06:00] have out here or opening a cocktail or something that's like a memory of the flood? Or It could be better. \n\n**Speaker 10:** Probably over with a clocked tower. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 9:** What do you think it would look like? \n\n**Speaker 10:** I wouldn't know. Probably a big rock or, yeah, yeah. A couple of big rocks from down there.\n\nThat's a \n\n**Speaker 9:** good idea actually. Yeah. Yeah. Put it \n\n**Speaker 10:** there and put a plaque there and, \n\n**Speaker 9:** yeah, \n\n**Speaker 10:** yeah, \n\n**Speaker 9:** yeah. That's cool. Awesome. That's about it. \n\n**Speaker 10:** Color it blue or whatever, like the rain, you know? That's \n\n**Speaker 9:** a good idea. Yeah. Cool. We're just, we're photo. I might have even try to pull one off here if I can. Um, \n\n**Speaker 11:** sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nAlright, stay.\n\nAwesome. [00:07:00] That's it.\n"

        "# Uncle Frank Daniel Landers\n\n[00:00:00] \n\n**Speaker 18:** Yes. Your full name? I'm Frank Daniel Sson and F-R-A-N-K-D-A-N-I-E-L-A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N. Yes. And it's good to be today, you know, telling the story of the past and how I come to be on, um, and, uh, you know. And then the things we've been and we went through, and it's good to, uh, try and explain that, you know, the best way I can.\n\nAnd, uh, yes, that's it. You know? \n\n**Speaker 19:** How do you, how do you start that story? What, how do you Yeah. How do you best start sort of, \n\n**Speaker 18:** well, where we came from? Mm-hmm. Where the centers from it came from, our family came from ham. Ingham just over there. [00:01:00] Uh, they sent a different tribes here, so our family came from Ingham, Halifax over here, uh, in, in, uh, in the forties.\n\nYeah. Came here in 1945. Our family, my mother and father and, and us. And, uh, that's way back, you know. And, uh, we stayed in the, in the village for a while until my mother got sick. And, uh, so they sent her away to the hospital and they put us in different, uh, what shall we say? We call 'em dormitories boys' homes, and they put us in the boys' homes.\n\nAnd the girl's sisters were in the dorm, girl dormitories, you know? [00:02:00] And, uh, so that's where we, we started our, uh, our dormitory lives. And, uh, that's when we, um, you know, governed by other men, people, you know, looking after us bosses. And, um, yeah, that's back 1945 from there up more or less went to school through there, over to, done my schooling the year on Palm from there.\n\nAnd, uh, I grew up through until 21. I left the boys home. But during that time, you know. We had to, uh, go by the rules, you know, and they were rules. We [00:03:00] had to stay and, uh, go by those rules. And, uh, it would've helped us, I suppose, kept us in place. Um, yes. And as I, uh, grew up. Then, uh, we went around into the camp, you know, we, they said, oh, we can go out and stay in the village.\n\nSo, uh, they gave us a home down there and, and we started to, uh, mingle with the outsiders. Otherwise, we was, we, when we were living the dormitory life, you have to stay in that area. You cannot. If you go out, you go out with the, in the, with the mob, not single handed. You know, you had to go a police or somebody to take you [00:04:00] and, uh, and bring you back or your boss.\n\nYeah, it was good, uh, in a way, uh, I thought it was all right in them days, but, um. Then I got my work job then, uh, with the, uh, with the, uh, adults here and on farm. Had a good job. And, but, uh, mainly, I suppose you just wanna know about,\n\nuh, what it was like during the government days. Mm. Yeah. Well, we had police here. You know, and we had to, we had to go by rules. We couldn't please ourselves. We had to go by rules and do what they want told us to do. And, um, [00:05:00] and they gave me, they gave us jobs, like was saying, I got a job. Then through they said, oh, you sent, sent me out to, uh, sheep station.\n\nI. Can you ride a horse? No, go anyway. They'll teach you. And uh, I went out, I stayed there for three years. You know, I got, I got to like it even though it was blowing some and, and you had on young, but that, those lives, they were okay. But, you know, during my.\n\nDays here on the settlement? Well, you know, we, I had to work in, uh, in, with the, uh, this Senator, Senator Bonner. He was, he was just, uh, [00:06:00] he was my boss then and uh, and I used to hand out tools to all the working men there. During them days. That's my job. I work in the, uh, overseas office. You it. \n\n**Speaker 20:** Mm-hmm. \n\n**Speaker 18:** And uh, and then they all line up there in the morning before work.\n\nThey ring a bell and we all, uh, gotta get online there in the morning, every morning, during the week. Be there seven o'clock. If you don't turn up there, you could go. That put you in jail, you gotta be there. You know? So, uh, that's, that's the rules. So, and if you, uh, missed out, you had no reason. You go in seven days down, down the road, they [00:07:00] put you down there.\n\nThat's it. Yeah. Uh, we, it was pretty well hard and. Hmm. In one way, you know, it's good in another way. Straighten us out a lot. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And my parents, you know,\n\nthey had to go by the, uh, rules and regulations. Mm-hmm. And what, uh, the duck, the, uh, government, you know, wanted us to do. Until that day when they went on strike. Hmm. And then when they went on strike, I wasn't here then. I was in, in Townsville. Like I went away from here. And, uh, they went on strike here, some men.\n\nAnd uh, that's when everything changed. [00:08:00] Then the people who were. We were looking after the, all of us, you know, the white race, they, uh, they uh, sort of, uh, packed up. They all went and packed up and, and went, got on the boat and they just left the place. See, and they no more, they didn't wanna stay here no more.\n\nNo one were looking after the place, looking after us. So they went out and let us, and it turned out to be what it is now. So they all went, took their swag, the white people. Mm-hmm. And, uh, and, uh, started to, uh, we see how we are living today. \n\n**Speaker 21:** What, what happened straight afterwards? Did you have to like, create.\n\nLeaders and [00:09:00] government and stuff. Like how did that work? \n\n**Speaker 18:** They were there. Yeah. Like they were here. Uh, yeah, of course, of course. They had to mm-hmm. Create leaders and, uh, as I say, Senator and Neville Bonner was here. Mm-hmm. That's how he come to be, where he got to, you know, and he was one of our leaders here.\n\nAnd, uh, joy and Ryan. Oh, there's a few of them guys. Mm. There's five or six got kicked off the island because of the strike. \n\n**Speaker 22:** Mm. \n\n**Speaker 18:** They put 'em off, come and grab them at night. Mm. And put 'em on the boat. Family and all. And away they went. They were the one who caused the stripe. Mm-hmm. And, uh, that's what it is today, is what it turned into.\n\nYou see, see what it's like now. [00:10:00] So, uh, at least there's no more lining up every morning, Hey, and ringing bells like they used to. \n\n**Speaker 21:** What, what does this idea of like community owned or indigenous owned or having agency, like, what does that mean to you? Is that mean much or? Like what, um, what's the difference between what it was like when you were told what to do versus now when there's \n\n**Speaker 20:** Yeah.\n\n**Speaker 21:** Decisions and governance, like, what's the difference, do you think? Is it much difference for you or is it very sort of similar? \n\n**Speaker 18:** Uh, what's it like? What was it like then? \n\n**Speaker 21:** Mm. \n\n**Speaker 18:** Uh, what we own today? \n\n**Speaker 22:** Mm. \n\n**Speaker 18:** Well, I think, uh. No, I don't know. Mm. It's, we just go [00:11:00] along day by day, you know? Mm-hmm. I don't dunno. And why children?\n\n**Speaker 22:** Mm-hmm. \n\n**Speaker 18:** Uh, of course, uh, we weren't made to do, we are not made to do. Now you was made to do what you, uh, didn't want to do, but you was made to do it. You had to do it in them days. But now, uh, it's all right. You can choose. Mm. And you choose if you wanna do it now. And, uh, well, of course there's a difference between that then and now.\n\nMm. Yeah. I think, uh, it's all right. We've got our own choices. Mm. Hey, and then. We didn't see. Mm-hmm. You had to do otherwise look out. Mm-hmm. You had to do whether you wanted to or didn't want to, you had to do, [00:12:00] or what, what do you \n\n**Speaker 21:** think needs to change now to help change some of the community? Um, problems and issues and, 'cause I think when you're not forced to do something and you have your own choice, there's lots of.\n\nLike bad things that can happen, right? Oh yeah. \n\n**Speaker 18:** They do what they want to these young people. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yes. Uh, well think it's, it's not so bad. Uh uh I think things may be a bit outta hand to some people. Mm-hmm. I mean, the young people, how they be behave.\n\nWe just have to straighten, straighten things out there, you know? \n\n**Speaker 20:** Mm-hmm. \n\n**Speaker 18:** And if we think they're doing the wrong thing, well they, we'd have to, uh, put 'em into place, you know? Mm-hmm. Uh, I don't see much, [00:13:00] I don't think they caused too much trouble. \n\n**Speaker 21:** Mm. Sometimes there's a lot of energy put into. This stuff though, like if you think about the government's always talking about youth crime or youth problems or people getting in trouble.\n\nOh, well that's, \n\n**Speaker 18:** yeah. That's sort of worldwide. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Well, you know what? Uh, \n\n**Speaker 21:** but yeah, I think there's like some quite powerful ideas or moments that can happen from. The community's working it out themselves. Right? Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 18:** If, uh, they, they've got problems here, well, they should, uh, we should all know about it, you know, and, uh, try and work it out, see what we can do about it.\n\nMm. [00:14:00] Uh, \n\n**Speaker 21:** together. Right. \n\n**Speaker 18:** Together. Yeah. And, uh. They getting mon in the law and all that, and, uh, try and fi uh, figure things out for themselves. As I said, they like, uh, we're trying to make it a community thing, you know, instead of a group, but we all, all to get together and straighten out a lot of things out.\n\nMm-hmm. You know? Yeah. Uh, together. Mm-hmm. You know, hey. \n\n**Speaker 21:** Mm-hmm. Totally. I think there's way more opportunities to do things together and openly and transparently than behind doors. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 18:** Yeah. Yep. That's right. Uh, yeah, I think, uh, that's the way. But yeah. How we going on today is [00:15:00] we're still trying to, uh, work things out, you know?\n\n**Speaker 20:** Hmm. \n\n**Speaker 18:** And, uh, still looking for answers. \n\n**Speaker 21:** Hmm. \n\n**Speaker 18:** But, uh, gradually it's gonna come, Hey, we hope, you know, \n\n**Speaker 21:** I think the more that we can share diverse community stories and opinions and work together on those, the more, the better. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 18:** Yes. Oh, well, there's a lot of d difference today than what it was Mm. When I was young.\n\n**Speaker 20:** Mm-hmm. \n\n**Speaker 18:** I was told to do a lot of things and had to do it. \n\n**Speaker 20:** Mm-hmm. Yeah. More complexity here \n\n**Speaker 18:** today. There's arguments now that you, you don't, you tell 'em, no, I don't have to do it, but that's everywhere. Mm-hmm. But that's every, you know. Mm-hmm. That's Palm today. That's all over. [00:16:00] But, uh. Well, you see, this is what it is today.\n\nNow what? What you see now? \n\n**Speaker 21:** Mm-hmm.\n\nI reckon we could take some photos. Yeah, yeah, \n\n**Speaker 18:** of course. Why not?\n"

      "Bio": "Uncle Frank Daniel Landers is a respected Elder and storyteller whose life spans the dramatic shifts in Palm Island’s history. Born in 1945 and raised in the dormitory system after being removed from his family, he grew up under government control—working jobs assigned to him, lining up daily for instructions, and living under strict regulation. He witnessed the Palm Island Strike and the transition to community self-governance. Today, Uncle Frank reflects with wisdom on the past and believes in community-led healing, unity, and straightening things out together—not through force, but through shared responsibility.\n\n"

        "# Ferdys staff\n\n**Speaker 31:** [00:00:00] Services and community wellbeing. That's our current service agreement with the funding mob for two years. Um, that includes either individual case manage support group programs, um, community engagement. Anyone else wanna expand on that? \n\n**Speaker 32:** Did she miss anything? No, Cole, I'd love someone to say what's the part of the job that they like the most?\n\nMaybe have anyone like what do you like about the job? \n\n**Speaker 34:** Yeah. My name is Iris and I've been a caseworker for some time now. I enjoy the job and I believe my job is to, um, support and empower women who are struggling and there's a lot of women struggling an alcohol drug and just basic living. So I enjoy my job and I.\n\nI'm open to [00:01:00] grandma, um, a supportive person in the community. Yeah. Mm-hmm. \n\n**Speaker 35:** I'm an, oh, sorry. Go. Can you go first? I'm Andrea. I just came on board last year. Oh, the two years now. Um, I love my job. I love looking forward for the woman. Um, we have a, uh, like a woman's group every Tuesday, Wednesdays, and I really look forward to coming into that.\n\n'cause we actually sit down, yarn, do a lot of laughing. We do hearts and craft down there and we sort of like came together. We knowing each other for a while now. So we're like our families and that's what I love doing is like being there and helping people. \n\n**Speaker 31:** I think just to follow on from I and Andrea, um, very good work that they do.\n\nWe have had. Ladies coming two thirties for [00:02:00] years. Um, we started our group back in 2014, so it's been going a long time now. Um, and we, we see the rewards in, um, and changes a person goes through from engaging in the programs and getting support here. Um. And some might, might drop off, but they do come back and always welcome.\n\nUm, we do support 18 years and over. Uh, that's our, our target group. However, Shannon at present is helping some high school girls that was out of a need to provide support. The high school asked for us to. Provide some education and that's what Shannon's doing. And [00:03:00] they seem to, the girls seem to get on well with her.\n\nUh, previously Shannon was our youth early inter intervention worker. Um, but we're not providing youth services at present. \n\n**Speaker 36:** Mm. \n\n**Speaker 32:** So, awesome. Um, I'm gonna ask a very specific question now. Um, there was a big storm. And there was some, it was actually quite close to here where they had the road out. Yeah. Does someone wanna share what that was, what that sort of period was like for themselves?\n\nFirst of all, foremost, was there some like big effects or small effects on any of you personally with your house or your family when that happened? Some big storms that were like February, like January, February? Yeah. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 31:** Um, just a lot of, a lot of rain, obviously. Mm. Uh, which can. Impact your travel to work, which it did when we were blocked off there for a bit.\n\nAnd, [00:04:00] um,\n\nno power. No power. Actually there was no power. That was that. Um, we couldn't come to work. That was for one day, couple of days here where we're located. Very exposed, obviously. Mm-hmm. So we get a lot of wind in here. Um, we didn't have any damage to thirties, which I'm happy about. Mm-hmm. But there may have been stuff happening through community.\n\nI know that there were trees that had come down different places, all the rocks and all of that, and it come down off the hill. Was, um, actually a very big impact was not getting grocery supplies over. So we were [00:05:00] out of a lot of stuff for considerable period of time. 'cause the blocking was from both south and north for a bit.\n\nUm, yeah, you just had to make, do. With what's in the store. \n\n**Speaker 32:** What, what's the general feeling in community do you think, when stuff like that happens? Like, I've heard so many different thoughts of like, sometimes it's hard for individuals to ask for help. Is a bit of shame there. Um, some are more affected by others 'cause of location.\n\nLike is there anything that you sort of found, especially during that time that was different or the same as that at all? \n\n**Speaker 31:** Um. Just from my observations probably is that the further the community PE people live out from the main central area, I can see it being harder. 'cause if [00:06:00] it's raining and that a lot of people don't have their own vehicles and transport, there's no public transport.\n\n**Speaker 36:** Mm. \n\n**Speaker 31:** So I don't know how much they were impacted like that. Those of us with vehicles. And we can probably take that stuff for granted, you know, and not consider it. But I think that's a, a big one. \n\n**Speaker 36:** Mm. Um, \n\n**Speaker 31:** especially for the mob that are rodeo ground, sleeping around the bay and they don't have cars having to get into the shops when it's raining, you know?\n\nYeah, yeah. \n\n**Speaker 35:** But, um, even the mark and the rodeo ground, even when we did get all that rain. The roads were cut off. So it was finding it hard. They couldn't come in to go to the store and get food. \n\n**Speaker 36:** Yep. '\n\n**Speaker 35:** cause the road was cut off and they couldn't get through. Yeah. That creek. So, yeah. Because of the creek sort of from the dam sort of came over and they couldn't get through.\n\nYeah. Even though they had [00:07:00] four wheel drives, but they still couldn't come through Mm. To get food. Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 31:** We, we had two staff members that were living down that way at the time. Mm. Yeah. That couldn't come to work. 'cause of that. \n\n**Speaker 35:** And I think Pick was going around one part giving, um, food, food, none of food, boxes of food for the people in the community.\n\nEven council was doing that. Council was doing that as well with water. So, yeah. \n\n**Speaker 32:** That's good. Um, what's the, I need to, need to make sure I need to. Need to leave in about 15 minutes. So I'm just trying to, um, and we've gotta take some photos. Um, what's do, do, do you all have, after especially doing this training and change, is there a particular vision that you'd love to see happen at thirties?\n\n[00:08:00] Like since it's almost a bit of a fresh start, or would you like it to stay the same, get bigger. What sort of stuff are you thinking about, about that? Or are you just trying to like, almost like reconcile where you're at? Almost. \n\n**Speaker 31:** There is still that, you know, we're still trying to find our feet, so to speak, our place within pick 'cause it's all new to us.\n\nUm, in terms of thirties, um, I always promote it as a place of healing. And I'd love more of our community coming and using the space. 'cause it's here for, for the whole community to be using. Mm-hmm. Um, so it is day based programs at the moment. It's not residential [00:09:00] and, and just for people who just wanna be able to come down, get out of home, have somewhere nice.\n\nTo sit somewhere safe that we are here. If they want to talk, they don't have to. Mm, they might just wanna sit quietly and reflect. Um,\n\nI have a, a lot of thought. Books on what's possible. Yeah. So I dunno about anyone else. Iris. Iris has been here the longest with me. \n\n**Speaker 34:** Yeah. Feel as a drug\n\ncenter, um, that the community should be using and.\n\nThat fear of making [00:10:00] changes back then, it wasn't fearful for people who needed help when it opened up in 1993. I'm guessing there would've been a lot of clients here engaging with pro with the program that they had they had here back then. Um, now 'cause of the generation has changed, there's other drugs.\n\nMm. \n\n**Speaker 36:** And \n\n**Speaker 34:** we're training up now to how to cancel those people. And now what the other drug, um, because, you know, alcohol abuse are now and \n\n**Speaker 36:** mm-hmm. \n\n**Speaker 34:** That generation's not taken it seriously about their health and wellbeing due to alcohol and drugs. Mm-hmm. So the community has a battle too. Well, I built that on the other drugs.\n\n**Speaker 32:** Mm. So good. Yes. All right. We better take some photos, but can we do one more [00:11:00] thing? I may or may not have caught all of your names on recording. \n\n**Speaker 31:** That's why I said we're gonna write 'em down. Can we?\n\nSo you didn't first record on any of that? \n\n**Speaker 32:** No. And I always wonder whether to tell people that because it makes me look very unprofessional. \n\n**Speaker 35:** Did you record us there? \n\n**Speaker 32:** The whole thing? I did, but not the first. So can we go around and do the names again? Sorry, one more time. Okay. \n\n**Speaker 35:** Shannon Morgan.\n\nS-A-J-N-N-O-N-M-O-I-G-A-N. And I'm a case worker. \n\n**Speaker 31:** CIA Ledger. I'm gonna write that down for you. I'm the service manager. Yeah, \n\n**Speaker 34:** I was Canada, I remember that one. A case worker. Yeah. And enjoyed my work the.\n\nYou \n\n**Speaker 33:** photogenic, \n\n**Speaker 36:** awesome. Irene \n\n**Speaker 33:** knowledge, not ours. Um, [00:12:00] anyway, I'm the cleaner here and this year, my 13 years for me, and, um, I really love being a cleaner and, you know, um. I also worked back in the time of Piera back in, uh, 85, 86, and I've been a cook. So we had this place full packed with patients, so I enjoyed the time, but mostly were our elders who be here.\n\nUm, and folks all passed on now. But I love my job being here and, um, I just like being on my own quiet, but I enjoy my. Um, my work is er and doing really well, and I just love just being here and just during the time of I do my cleaning, you know, and just, yeah, that's it. \n\n**Speaker 32:** That's your whole, um, position description, sort of?\n\n**Speaker 31:** Yeah. Brandon Casters, I'm the administration officer. \n\n**Speaker 32:** Awesome. And last one, [00:13:00] \n\n**Speaker 35:** Andrea Casters case worker. \n\n**Speaker 32:** Awesome. Okay.

        "Some people get up, the purpose is to go to work every day. Some people might have something planned for the day. What purpose do we have? What purpose have we set for ourselves to get us out of bed every morning? And to be able to do the things that we need to do. When we're drinking or even on drugs, I can relate to drinking because I never take drugs. But the purpose for me to get up every morning was to go and look for my next drink. That was my purpose in life. You know? Satisfaction, I suppose. Satisfaction. To satisfy yourself. You get the satisfaction out of what purpose you set for yourself. And something that you've accomplished. But what gets us out of bed every day? We need to set that for ourselves. We all have our different priorities. And like I said, some people get up and their purpose in life, their purpose for that day is to go to work. Because the end result of that, at the end of the day, is you're working to make some money for yourself. To buy the things that you need to live. You know? So what other purposes that we might have in life today? You know? But we have to set that for ourselves. We decide what we're going to, how our daily lives, how we set that and how we accomplish that on a day-to-day basis. And like I said, when we're drinking, the first thing we do is look for our first drink. That's the purpose. Some people look for drugs. Some people, some people just, just don't know what they're going to do on that day. You know? So we have to set that. We decide what kind of a day we're going to have. Whether we, what kind of a, not only what kind of a day we're going to have, but we set the, what kind of, whether we're going to feel good about today. Or whether we're going to feel bad about today. Or, you know, all those things come into play. When we drink, we are the first people we basically want to look for is the drug dealers. Or the grog sellers, you know? They decide what kind of a day we're going to have. You know? Here's some drug. Here's some, here's some, here have a drink. They decide what kind of a day we have. You know? It's just like Paddy, you know? It's just like Paddy when you get up, people get up. On Paddy everybody get dressed up. Yeah, no, what they do. On Paddy, everybody in a good mood. You know? Saying hello to everybody. They need to be, they need to be aware, then what happened after that, then I, when it's all going, then I. You can't just let yourself down, go down, you know? So, focus on that, after all this. And you notice that, you know, you know, you're going to be a good mood. You notice that it becomes something, it becomes normal. It's like that. To do that. The day you put in the oven, the night, you know? You think, you think, you know? Even, even, we get to that point where we just program ourselves to only get dressed up on a payday. We only do certain things on a payday. You know? Because we feel like we're going to get paid. You know? How come we don't feel like that every day? You know? How come we don't feel good about ourselves? And, and what we're going to do on that day? How come we only do that on payday? You know? And you ask yourself that, well, if it wasn't pay week, or if it wasn't payday, how would you feel? How do you feel? How do you feel? You know, think about it. How do you feel? What do you do when it's not payday? You get up in a bad mood, or you feel bad, or you don't want to talk to people, or you don't want to, you know, do things. Or sleep all day, you know, or something like that. You know? But you notice that around the hour, you notice that people only, it's a good day for them on a payday. Yeah, and even the present payday, but not your payday, you must think I owe me money, and you don't give me that money back. You know, you pay somebody else, and I'll pay you. Give your pay, you know what I'm saying? You're up here, you're high on that. Just imagine, just think about it, when I'm payday, you're high. But once I, even on the same day, some people have to pay out all their money, and they end up with nothing. So they're up high one minute, feeling good about themselves, and feeling good what they're doing. I don't know, you know? Just in a good mood. And when all that money is going, bang, they're down here. They're feeling sad, they're feeling angry, they're feeling resentful, maybe. They regret that. Because they have paid that money out to the drug dealers, or side rogers, or loans, you know? Just a simple loan can put you in that situation, you know? Paying that out and ending up with nothing. On the same day, say you're high one minute, and you're down here the next. You know? And what we do? We've got to look for more drink, and get drunk, and punish ourselves. We take it out on ourselves. We punish ourselves. That's what men do. We just seem to do that. We just seem to punish ourselves. \n\nYou know? You can see the changes, didn't they? Right. You know? You know? You know? You know? You know? You know? You know? You know? You know? You know? You know? To do that. Get more growing, whatever. And you just feel down, didn't you know? You feel down, and you get angry. But maybe a lot of that anger is aimed at ourselves. Yeah. But we take it out on our partners. We take it out on our kids. We take it out on our friends. Just keep going, don't they? Keep going. You know? You know? I think it's a cycle. Until you try and address it somewhere. You know? You change it. Change it the other way, not the other. Yeah. That's right. I've been through the same process like that. Yeah, we all get that. Yeah. And I always got help from living light and ate one. Yeah, that's how I sort of always get it. Always put myself in a different shelter. Yeah. Because I knew that to go and speak to the right people to get help and all that. Because I told them I was sick of being on the street. Yeah. And being a big captain for a day. Yeah. And when I explained everything to the Mission Australia workers up in Cairns, I always had a lot of Christians writing with me and I always said to them, Look, I really need you to keep me out of a drunken shelter. Because where I'm living is a straightway road. And I said, we call that straightway road and alcohol is anonymous. Yeah. And I gave them a bit of a tip about alcohol is anonymous. Like what that one word you call it? Procrastination. Procrastination. Yeah. Putting things off. Putting things off and keep slipping back into our old ways. Yeah. Lifestyle. Yeah. And I said, I learned that from all the other people on Palma and some of them passed away. I said, lucky for me, if I didn't make that, I wouldn't have got the chance to see my three boys grow up. I wouldn't have the chance. But remember that these things, they apply to people who don't drink too. Who's not on taking drugs. Those same things apply to people who don't drink too. Because people who don't drink still go through the same thing that you go through. Ah, I thought we would just say. It's not just for a thing. I said, I'm talking about when you go through that process. Like I always say, what we talk about here, that applies to me too. Ah. Because I go through that too. You know, those things affect me too. You know, just because I don't drink any, that doesn't mean that we, you know, I don't have problems with my partner and all that sort of thing and everything that goes with it. That same thing applies to me too. I'm no different. But when it comes to DV, it affects everybody. But I can still, some people, a person who doesn't drink, can have the same thought process as someone who drinks. The same thinking, the same attitude. It's just that the difference is not drinking. You know, when it comes to attitude and then behavior, it applies to everybody. Whether you drink or not, whether you're black or white, whether you're rich or poor, it doesn't matter. It applies to everybody. You know? Because we're only human. We're all the same. And when it comes to that sort of thing, the best thing is, you know, the behavior, the attitude, the thought process, even the lifestyle can affect. It goes, it applies to everybody. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't you worry. Maybe you might hit that term, dry drunk. Because that's someone who's not drinking, still got the same thinking. Still got the same thinking as someone who's already drinking. Right. They never change up here. Never change, their attitude never change things. That is why it's very important that when we, when we look for changes, we need to change our attitude. We need to change our behavior. You know, we have to look at that on a daily basis. And we have to look at our behavior. Whether I disrespected that person or this person on a daily basis. Now, personally for me, I do that every day. You know, in my quiet time. And I look at myself, what kind of a day I had. Whether I've disrespected people or whether I, you know, and I can go up and say, I apologize. I have to look at my behavior. Because I can't, I can't sit down here and talk about it and say, it applies to you. It don't apply to me. You know, that's wrong for a start, you know. Because all those things we talk about, it applies to me too. I've got to, uh, change my attitude too. I've got to keep reminding myself that, that if I go off track in my thinking, in my attitude, if I, if I, if my old attitude come back, I can end up back down the park. Simple as that. That one drink can put me back down the park. That is why I have to look at myself on a daily basis. So I can stay sober and live life, you know. And feel good about myself. You know. And, and when, when we live our daily life, we're going to have a purpose to get up in the morning. You know, my purpose is to go to work every day. Um, my, my purpose is to, is to, um, achieve some type of goal on a daily basis. I said, you know, like you plan for the day, eh? I think we all, we all get to that point where we all plan what we're going to do today. And, and I try and plan for the day and do the things I need to do. Sometime I don't do it. Sometime I don't want to do it, you know. Motorgrads, you know. I don't like mountain grass. But, you know, I put that off sometime and don't do it, you know. But, but that's a show. We're, we're only human and, and, and, and, and, and, and we do, uh, procrastinate and, and put things off. That applies to everybody, me too, me included. But when we talk about living a life, changing, we're not going to deal with, it's not going to get to a point where we're not going to have problems. We're not going to always going to have problems, they. But it's just that we, we are able to deal with it. Find ways, finding ways to deal with anything that comes up. Finding ways to, to achieve some goal that we set for ourselves. That is why we need to change and keep on top of it, you know. By reminding ourselves that, that, um, um, that I don't want to go back to my old, my old way. I want my life to change. And our kids will see that change and they'll benefit. They'll see the change and they'll change also. Our partner will change. Um, it's like the ripple effect. You know when you throw a rock in the water and that ripple comes out? Well it spreads out to our family and friends. That ripple. And they see the change. And they'll, they'll, they'll see us in a different way. You know? Maybe we'll get that respect back. You know? People will see us differently. They don't see us as just a drunk or just a drug addict or something. They'll see us in a different way. You know? And one of those changes that, that, that, that we can, we can do is getting involved in things. Anything to do with the community. Doing the Kapmarri. That was the old purpose of why I asked you to help with the Kapmarri. Is to, once you get in, you get involved in things like that, you feel good about yourself. Giving something back, eh? Giving something back. Putting something back, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you feel good about yourself and you feel that you've achieved something. You know? And then, and that's because just doing, getting involved in that and doing a, doing a simple thing like that, Kapmarri. That's the old purpose of it. That's why I asked you men to get involved. Being part of something, being part of this community. Being part of this community. And that's what it's all about. You know? Because community, the word community is made up of two words. Common and unity. We, every single one of us on this island, we have something in common. We're all Bulgurmen. That's what we have in common. And through that, being a Bulgurman, we, we, there's unity, knowing that, knowing that we are Bulgurmen. And we put that unity into practice by getting involved and doing a Kapmarri. You know? Things like that. But on top of that, we, we, it makes us feel good about ourselves. Like we've achieved something. We've achieved something for that day. You know? And that, and I think that's a good thing. You know? Because when we stop, um, you see a lot around, you see around a lot of places where people, like I said before, you see people, uh, got the attitude, oh, fuck you, you know? I don't give a fuck about you, you know? But that attitude needs to change. And that's the biggest, the biggest problem on Palm Island is attitude. I reckon. Because of that. I've got what I want, you know? That attitude, you know? What I've, we, people work for things. People, uh, buy things. But you look at, you look at, um, you see it a lot here. People buy boats. But they take their friends and family out. They're not like, oh, fuck you, you go buy your own boat. You know? And maybe some people got that attitude. Even they might say that about their own family. I mean, oh, fuck you, you go buy your own boat. You know? But you see a lot of that here on Palm, where people got boat and they take friends and family out, you know? They see that every week. People go out hunting, go out, men go out to the island, you know? Take their friends and family. Go out hunting, you know? Basically, um, that, that, that sharing or that caring and sharing, that comes into, you know? And that's part of our culture. The caring and sharing, that's part of Aboriginal culture. And that's something we practice. You know? And that, that, that, that's where, that's what, that's one example, you know? Of, of, of, um, uh, that caring and sharing. You know? And I think that's a good thing. You know? And we, and we see that a lot. We see a group of men go out, go out hunting for turtles. And when you're back, when you get a lot of fish too, you put the lexic fish you send out to your family too, you know? Yeah. You not to say anything you sent the fish and if you should give it out to family and friends. I mean, they do that too when you, you, you know? buvey sketch by or sage, um, cank and bark. See? I mean, sometimes it makes them feel comfortable. Hey, can we get those cheese? Yeah. Yeah. So we still got to, we'll go call the Tetle해주 just aria with Australia. We still got those cultural values. We still got the cultural values of sharing, caring and sharing, of sharing what we have. No matter we worked for it and paid it off and done all that, that doesn't come into it. It's just that the end result is we got it. And we use that to take our friends and family out, you know. But there are some people here who got that attitude, you know, like you, you go buy your own dog, go get your own fish and turtle. Some people do have that attitude, you know. But you see, most of it, a lot of people share. A lot of people share that fish when they catch a turtle, you know, and do things for the community, you know. And we're at a point now where things are happening all the time here on Palm, you know, with functions, eh? Functions. And sometimes it's hard to get someone to help with those, you know. That's why we're going to be able to, if we want to make that change to better ourselves, \n\nI believe we need to get involved in those sort of things, those functions, you know. Help out, just help out anywhere there, you know, where you can help, you know. \n\nHelp do things. I've come across a situation yesterday where they've organized down that thing here. Yesterday, that... Bulgum Monday. What was it? That barbecue? Yeah, I don't know. You said they had a barbecue down here. Yeah, somewhere in the morning, eh? Yeah. Yeah, yesterday. Yeah. Oh, that's what the holiday was for. Bulgum Monday, yeah, establishment day. They opened up Palm, eh? Establishment day, or something like that, yeah. Yeah, Bulgum Monday, yeah. Yeah. And, you know, some of them... I was told that they have to find someone to help out. There's a couple of people there to help, but not enough. That's what the same process we went through, eh? Yeah. Same thing, eh? I went through the same thing. In other words, eh, you know? Last week. And I gave one of the other boys, come on, give us a hand, eh? No one gave a hand. Last minute, eh? Russell was there doing all the work and... Bulgum. Bulgum. Bulgum. You know, when I asked the many to chip in and just help out, you know? It was tiring, but I felt good after it, eh? Yeah, you do feel good after it, eh? Yeah, you do feel good after it, eh? Yeah. You get involved in that, you know? You make... You feel good. The thing is, to make yourself feel good about yourself. \n\nBecause... Probably for years, we've been punishing ourselves and making us... We... We punish ourselves for the things we did, for the things we didn't do, for the things we said, and for the things we didn't say. We punish ourselves for that. And we make ourselves feel bad about ourselves, you know? We start hating ourselves. So we punish ourselves. And we take it out on our family and friends. But doing something like that, you feel good about it, doesn't it? You achieve something, yeah? And, um... Um... And that's what we need to do on a daily basis to... To live life... To be able to live on a daily... To live life is to make yourself... Keep yourself in that... Way that you feel good about yourself. To change your daily day around. If you're feeling good, bad about yourself... Change it around to make yourself feel good about yourself. By doing something. Maybe doing something for someone else. Helping someone else with something. To make yourself feel good about yourself, you know? \n\nBecause... We can't just sit back and allow other people to decide what kind of a day we have. We can't... We can't... Control... We've got no control over our life. Where we're going to leave it up to someone else to decide that. You know? And a good example is... Is, um... A good example of that is... When you go to the court... When you go to court... That magistrate decide what kind of a day you're going to have. You're going to decide what... What's going to happen in your life... And what's going to happen to you. That magistrate... You're going to decide that. Not you. You got no say over that. \n\nThen you're allowed the police to decide what kind of a day you have when they... When you... When they come around to check on you at night. What they... What they do... What they do... What they call them? Care for you. Care for you. Or... If you're on parole or something. You know? Or something. They're going to come check. You're giving them the power to control your life. Now what do you do? You know? \n\nAnd that's... And that's what's happened when you go to court. When you get... When you, um... Go to court for whatever reason. Because you've given other people power to decide what happened with you. With your life. The magistrate decided... Right. You go to jail for 12 months. You gave them the power to do that. You know? \n\nThat's what happens. \n\nEven with the drug dealers and the sly groggers. Because... You give them the power... To control your life. They decide what kind of a day you have. They decide how much you pay too. No, I think they... You know? But you give them that power... To control who you are. Control what day you're going to have. \n\nThen what happens? We take it out on our family and friends. We take it out on our kids. We take it out on ourselves. \n\nYou know? \n\nOnce we get... Once... Once we get independent... Because... Through all that situation now with the drug and whatever... DV... It gets to a point in our life... Where we're dependent... On other people... To do things for us. Maybe it gets to a point where... We're dependent on that drug dealer. We'd be... We'd be... Dependent on that drug. Yeah, we'd be... Addicted to it. Then we become dependent on that drug dealer. A drug dealer to decide... What we do. Where we go. How to behave. He's making all that decision for us... By giving us that... Drug. We're not independent. We think we are. But we're not. We become independent. Okay? Is that right? Now we become dependent. I'm saying. We're not independent. We're not deciding what kind of a day we are going to have. That drug dealer is. \n\nThat magistrate... Maybe some people get... Get... Get in a situation where they... Can't function out here in a community. They can only function in a jail. You know... They become... Dependent. \n\nAnd they feel more comfortable. Some people maybe... Feel more comfortable in jail. Because they get their sleep meals a day. Bed to sleep. Things like that. That's not part of the reason. \n\nBut... Depending on... To... To... To... Live our life. To make decisions for us. We need to break away from that. And become... Independent. Where we can decide... What... What... Kind of a day we're going to have. Where we go. And what we do. We make that decision ourselves. You know? And we have to become independent. \n\nAnd one of the ways... One of the examples of being independent... Is having a job. Is having a job. You know? Because you feel good about yourself... Coming to work. You feel good about working. \n\nPlus the money that you make... Is a lot better than living on Centrelink. You know? You can afford to... To buy the things that you need... For yourself. And for your kids. And family. And your house. And... You feel that independent. \n\nAnd that's a good feeling to have. \n\nYou know? Because when you... If you're on... Just say you're on Centrelink. You're depending on the government. The government is looking after you. You're depending on the government... For that payment every fortnight. You don't have to do nothing. \n\nYou know? But when it comes to work... You have to go to work every day. That's a decision you have to make. You know? It's easy. It's good to have a job. But you have to be... Able to make that... Make your own decision. Whether you... Get to a point where you make your own decision. Whether you go to work or not. You know? And that's a... That's a... That's a beauty about being independent. It's your decision to make. When you're independent. And if you choose not to go to work... That's fine. If you choose to work... That's fine too. But it's your decision to make. You decide what kind of a day... You're going to have... When you're independent. Not someone... Not a magistrate... Or the police... Or... You know? Or some drug dealer... Or some drug dealer. \n\nSo that is what we need to work towards. To break away from that dependency. You know? Maybe... Maybe... Maybe... We get some young... We get some young people today who... Depending... Still depending on their mother. Grown men. Still... Still holding on to their mother's skirt. That's still happening today. Grown men. Yes. Yep. Yeah. They're waiting for their mother to get their pension. Or... Grandmother. And go... Give them... You know? Some money. I've seen that happen. It happens to you. I know it happens to you. I've seen it. We grow with men who... Maybe... I've seen some young persons... Not even on the center. And... Still holding on to... \n\ntheir mother scared and that's in there for money every fortnight we are taught as men that when you grow up, when you get old enough, when you leave school you either go into a trade or doing a apprenticeship or you go and find work and look after yourself that's how it's supposed to work, you know years ago that's how it worked once you get 17 or 18 you leave school, the best thing you do is look for a job \n\nwhen I left school in grade 10 my father said, oh well, you don't want to go to school, you're on your own, you look after yourself from there now I had to look after myself doesn't matter, I lived in the park I had to look after myself my dad wasn't going to look after me and he told me that \n\nbut today we got some young father who is still holding on to mummy's skirt and still depending on their mother to provide them with money and everything else and they're violent you know that's how it's not supposed to be like that but that's just how things turned out that's just how things turned out here on Palm because more and more people are more dependent on the government now than before by vacancy hey you know it's a simple thing like a company looking for a voucher every fortnight they're dependent on it, eh, see yeah people depend on that voucher they don't have to budget their money you know this is how I see it some people don't have to budget their money because they know they can get a voucher to get food and it's for free for free that's being that's not being independent you know that's being independent the programs, some of the programs here are making you dependent on them and by giving out a voucher and keeping you in that dependency mode and it does more damage than good you know quite naturally yeah because you don't have to work for it you don't have to do anything you just get a voucher or I'll get some we think it's we think we're maybe a situation where we think it's okay I'll get something for free the storm of the storm but it's doing more damage to you but it's doing more damage to you because it's keeping you dependent on them it's keeping you dependent on Janet and the workers here myself and Isabelle you're depending on them to give you a voucher so you can buy food instead of budgeting what money you get so you can have food you know that would happen Monday eh a few people come there a few people come there look at the pastor and I ain't no need either way I want to get a voucher but they don't have ads or they're trying to tell them one after the other it must be from me they went over here there was a company in the last spot yeah people do that they go around different places and if they have a craving and if they have a craving if they don't have it eh that badger they're gonna lose or whatever they're gonna it's gonna change yeah it's gonna change it's like they don't want to give it or go around the other world they'll start cracking up they'll start cracking up yeah they think the thinking changes yeah see play that because the thinking changes in a way where they get angry because it's your job to give me a voucher yeah see yeah and they'll use that eh they'll use that and they and they maybe some people some will come up and say that it's your job to give me a voucher you know it's not my job to give you a voucher you know but some people the thinking changes in a way where where some people think that you're you're personally responsible for them okay that's how much damage that system that's how much damage that's done to us when we we become dependent on other people they think you're personally responsible I had one fellow come home to my house at night oh this is at night and they said oh you're gonna he come can you take me up the mission I said no no I'm not going anywhere he turned around and said to me but that's your job to look after me you know I get paid to help people yeah during working hours that's my job but after working hours now that's my own time but he actually came out and said that it's your job to look after me I just said give me a fuck over a bunch of you're not yeah yeah the government created that back in the days they made them old people hey you know before they relocate everybody hey yeah make them dependent on that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah breaking their breaking their the cultural values of yeah yeah black people didn't worry about that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah black people didn't worry about that but they sort of gave them an option hey if you don't want to do that's exactly what happened yeah go work slave labour you know yeah and you're working for nothing anyway you're working for that sugar flower yeah yeah see that was a cat the government done it on purpose and they and it's it's still today we see it today it's still today there it's still today there where people are getting vouchers today yeah but that is one way that's a maybe these things take time for that to happen before we realize and that's all I say educate yourself on these things you know and it's like an addiction hey they're gonna have it they're gonna have it that bad you see yeah and if they don't get it they blame you but then they change straight away they start pointing their fingers you know start pointing their fingers yeah see swearing everything and running around you know yeah people do that here now when we have no voucher we just that's ours that's ours the government runs out but that being dependent can be can do a lot of damage to us you know in our changes our attitude changes our behaviour in a way where where we got no control over that not only through the courts but being that being dependent on on government things but I have a lot of people coming in here looking for phones I broke my phone well you broke it that's your problem you know instead of just go buy another one you know but there's a free phone up here so I'll go up and get a free one you know it doesn't work like that that's another story I had that day no more yeah nothing everywhere it's only for people on dv it's only for people who go through a crisis if they if the person have to leave the house and go and live somewhere else they connect you know dv connect yeah you need that phone just for the support yeah to support that person same with the voucher same thing but people think they can just get a free phone and get a free voucher like that you know and it got to a point where it got that way and you know people came in I want my voucher yeah they're not entitled to get a voucher you know that's just how it is but that's how much damage that we can do to ourselves or that system can do to us where we become dependent on that that is why we have so many people coming in to the workout everyday free phone you know our main job is to help people in a crisis if they need to leave Palm and and and man or woman if they get in a dv situation we would have to leave Palm we got money there we can put someone up in a motel for a couple of weeks if they need to get away you know or if they got to go and they got nowhere to stay we can put them up in a motel things like that that's what that money in that fall for when people in a crisis and that applies to you many too if you're going through a hard time at home and you need a need a break we can put you up in a motel for a week or so so you can maybe go in town and get counselling or something you know you know \n\nbut we got what money or what things we we provide is for people in a crisis \n\nthat's it y'all \n\nsame with the vouchers supposed to be for people in a crisis \n\nsame same with anything else same with the phone but some people like to take advantage I just want a free phone you know \n\nI had one fellow coming here he had a phone in his van and he still asks me for a phone oh look you got a phone he can yeah but you give out free phone he no no no it don't work like that you know I remember I remember when he said oh god do a yeah they used to do that before yeah they used to do that before when he was making CP he said go there for an appointment and he said give us a free phone yeah three days later we used to try that same phone for the CR I think that's what people do but I think community correction still does it just for you to stay connected like especially if you don't make that yeah if you can't make it like just say you're working you're going to phone through see that's you know that's part of the little thing that's supposed to supply you with a bike like your own transport to get to one place or the other just to get in there if you can't sign on it at a certain time yeah I was like that when I was in Sydney working I just found through yeah so later reach out the fellow saying are you right what was the know you found in you know yeah the Asian fellow is a pretty good fellow too yeah from that situation where we went in yeah but that's part of the thing to give you that extra support see I'll ask them about that yeah that was good that still should be in the thing it should be what's the name you know just to say in touch like if you can't make it you'll find it through it's already recorded see I've given that phone to a couple of people who was in that situation where they couldn't contact yeah yeah yeah I've given that phone to many to do that you know well that's a situation like that where we do give out phones yeah yeah that's it yeah in where if there's a situation yeah if there's a crisis you know so you don't end up in jail you know but that's our role is to deal with that sort of thing but um it's not it's not about just getting a free phone or getting people it's about attitude because people's attitude change and we need to we need to change our attitude and make our and work toward being independent of government of you're not going to be fully independent I say we all we need government we need government in our lives sometimes you know you know we they provide good things too the government they don't have bad but they provide situations where you get the victim assist payment you know and and some of those things they can provide they can help you you know but we just got to be aware of we just got to be aware of of our own self whether we we are becoming dependent or whether we want to work toward dependency uh independency um that's a separate issue that's a separate issue than that's a separate issue than what the government does you know but they do provide some good programs but we just got to be aware of that if we don't become dependent on uh in that situation um but like I said as men we are we are growing up we are taught that men go out and work and go after their family we are taught that men protect their family and it happens here all the time but we are taught that when we are growing up when we are boys \n\nso and the the normal thing or the what's supposed what's supposed to happen is we get up when we leave school and go and look for a job and live after our family but a lot of times that don't happen um um palm is a situation where there's not really not really not much work hey it's hard to get a job but that doesn't stop us from getting a job getting training and going out on the mainland working nothing stopping us from doing that you know ask out about young colour um he's still working out in the mines maverick eh maverick ask out about him because he's going out there done his training in the mines and he's still out there working today he's married up he live in Kronkari that's deadly you know he's still out there working today you know he's still out there working today you know he's still out there working today you know a lot of other a lot of other grandfellas went out there and done the same training at the same time as him a lot of them left came back here but I've spoken about him because he's stuck to it he's working he's married up got his own place in Kronkari still working in the mines and that's deadly I think that was deadly and and and nothing stopping any of you probably from doing that you know or going to places like Bachelor up in Darwin ah Bachelor that's a it's a university now yeah yeah it's not a college anymore it's a university but you can go there they got a lot of stuff there that you can study they got construction also in there in the in that is it Charles Darwin Charles Darwin University yeah they they connected to Charles Darwin yeah you go to Charles Darwin I was talking about because I went there I went there when I was doing several months training with Kaua Niyawa they sent me to that place now you're talking about yeah they connected them to the main university yeah they connected to Charles Darwin and people from all over go there from all over Australia go to Bachelor and the old people too you know and they get their degree and they get their whatever they train whatever they are they got all that up there they got the how to run a radio station they got media media training they got construction they got a lot of a lot of different training up there that you can do a ranger training too they can do rangers when I was there they were doing rangers but nothing stopping you from doing that and they got indigenous section in all universities right throughout the country you can go to Perth you can go to uni over there they got an Aboriginal section there Sydney, Darwin Sydney, Melbourne they got it all over nothing stopping you from signing up and doing that to educate yourself to make your so that maybe down the track you can get a better job maybe you can get with a better pay you know the whole purpose of that is to sell that you can because we we we we on Palm we're living in two worlds we living in our our Aboriginal with our culture we're living we still practice a bit of that today so we get a plus we're also living in in a white man's world so we get a balance of that yeah we get a balance of that yeah we get a balance of that coming to work coming to work \n\nwhen I'm home yeah I'm myself I'm a bulldogman you know I'm a black man but when I come to work I've got my even my how I talk gotta change because I'm coming to a white man world and I'm gonna change to suit that where I my work environment so we're gonna make we do that all the time when we got Townsville we'd act differently we'd behave differently when we got Townsville because that's their way we're in there no matter where we go so we're constantly changing from one side to the other and we're gonna find a way to deal with that we're gonna find a way to be able to do that to live in to to bring those two cultures together and to be able to function within both sides in both of them you know and that takes a lot of it's a lot of doing to tell you the truth \n\nand a lot of people do make that be able to do that you know you know to be able to do that but we can do it but we just need to work at it \n\nbut we have to start off by changing our attitude \n\nyou know \n\nI read a book about to educate myself so I read books history books things like that um educated and I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm H I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm and Ivo this in in the in in and a in Because even back then in the old days, there were white people who tried to save black people, and who have saved black people, you know, from being taken and put on palm, you know, things like that. There were some good people out there, and that's where my thinking changed towards white Australia, because I thought white Australia was all bad. But my thinking changed and my attitude changed. How I interacted changed with white people. How I... And things have changed in a way where, you know, good things happen and bad things happen, you know? But a lot of people write about the bad things that happen, but there's a lot of good things that happen too. And like I said, I read about, I read the diaries, what they wrote, and there were some good too. You know? It wasn't all bad, you know? Like maybe some people make attitude to me. But the main thing was to change my attitude. The main thing was I'm living in this world today. It's a different world from when I was growing up. It's about education today. And it's about living in two society and bringing it together. It's about making me feel good about me. And changing. So that's a process maybe we need to go through to make that change. Because if we don't, we're going to be left back there. You know? And one of the first things I… One of the things I had to do, I had to go and… And I said, if we don't, we're going to be left back there. It's about making me feel good about me and changing. \n\nSo that's a process maybe we need to go through to make that change. \n\nBecause if we don't, we're going to be left back there. \n\nAnd one of the things I had to do, I had to go and, like I said, I went to Bachelor. I've done four years there, got my degree. \n\nI was 52, I think, when I went up, 52 or 53, when I signed up to go to Bachelor. Some people might think that's too old. \n\nBut Bachelor has been around for generations. It's been around for 20, 30 years or so. You know Bachelor, I think. I know it's been around a long time. But to change my life around to what it was and to educate myself, I had to go to Bachelor. To educate myself, I had to go walk on my mother's land up. I had to go walk that land, walk on any country. And meet family and talk and interact with family up there. I had to do that to make changes, to change myself. \n\nAnd this is where that money, you know, for that men's group. I think the men's group got 1.something million. 1.9 million. 1.9 million. 1.9 million. And that's for this sort of thing now. But they're going to be meetings about it, eh? Eh? So that. And that's what they're working towards now. Making changes. Men make those changes. But to make that change, we have to make that effort on our own to go and do those things. To make that change. Educate ourselves. You know? That's why there's that purpose for that, eh? The purpose is for that to change. To change, yeah. To make that change. And we have to, it's up to us as individuals to make that change. Don't wait for the, no one's going to do it for you. You have to do it yourself. No one's going to make, do it for you. If you find yourself, maybe you might wonder, how come I keep getting into trouble? How come I'm still going to jail? How come I'm getting charged with this over and over? Maybe it's time to look at yourself and say, what am I doing? Wow. To make that change, you know? \n\nWhat am I doing to help myself? Because no one's going to do it, you're not going to do it for us. \n\nAnd, um, we have to make that change for ourselves. But, you know, in the end, our, we benefit. \n\nAnd our family's benefit, you know? But we have to make that change. Because, tell you what, tell you the truth. That cemetery's full of people who never made that change. Didn't bother. That cemetery's full of people. Our family down there, even our family. People who never made that change. That cemetery's full of young people, too. Died young. I think I can only think of one person. \n\nI think there's only one person alive that I was in the same class with. Out of a group of, like, 12 boys. In one class. I can only think of one that's still alive today. The old rest of all passed away. \n\nThat's sad. But, the world has changed. And people, we have to change with it. And to be able to find a good job. \n\nAnd make a decent living. Is to educate yourself. \n\nChange your attitude. \n\nChange your behavior. These things have to happen. If we want to live in this world today. Because things have changed. When you look at what happened in Kauyama. My brother, B. Lawrence. He was running the men's group. And after. My wife, Nikki. Mom passed away. He had a job for all in. Seven years. And. When he was in the men's group. My brother, Doha. Yeah. We were lucky enough to score funds for Mom. We were on blue. Yeah. To the men's donga. And now we got the same donga. Situated up near the airport. But, what I'm wild with. Is. We all knew that we were going to have black deaths. In Kauyama. Yeah. I'm wild with. They gave the. Prime dongas. Two cattle companies. Women was for men's group. And they gave us a whole. Bainta donga. Yeah. And. When they gave us that. Bainta donga. Before they gave us that. That's when my cousin brother. From. No. They got. \n\nHe got. Blowed up in the white house. Yeah. And I was in. A couple of years at the time. I went on Facebook. And I was guessing the right time. Brother Doha went to the. Police station. To come back to the hospital. And finance when he was dead. When I was in. When I was in. King's work. My drunk. Yeah. And he said. I came in. I said. Look. I grew up in that place. I know a lot about that place. Yeah. Because I was very wild. Because. The cattle company. Took the new dongas over. And there was an old rotten donga. And everything got stolen out of it. Yeah. Yeah. And we got that old donga. Before that. Black deaths in custody. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They were in the name of Gary. Uh huh. Yeah. I was in Cairns at the night. And I had family members. \n\nAnd moved from Cairns, but sent away. We still got that placement. Back in California. Made him in banjar. The other piece they were, We started getting out of Eric. He's in Cairns. Yeah. They were just embracing it. Yeah. Un loyalty good. turkey. All that put them. Uh... We have a building down the corner, not from the coffee shop, but we're not using that building. We put more artifacts in there, more than a PCYC. That's where we have our youth group. That's what he's saying with that funding. It was a thing that we've been thinking about. And Yareba got the other 1.1 to set something up in it. Just like in the pipeline. I'm just tapping it. We took off him off, so maybe if we can not dip into it, I said, can we get a couple of vehicles for us men, you know? Yeah, you can't do that. We have a creek or a bay, whichever way. Get out of the mission, you know? That's men, you know? They said, no, it should be affordable, you know? Like a trophy and a jewel cap or two trophy, you know? That's part of the men's thing anyway, you know? Yeah. At the moment, like you're saying about the dongers, our two or three dongers just ran the airport. Ah! They're using the same thing that you said. They're using the men's group. They're using, see? That was for the men's group, Danny. That was for the men's group, Danny. That was for the men's group, Danny. Just as a start, you know? You see? You still get in touch with our brother, Billy Lawrence, Dave. He's around the men's group that after he lost his wife and auntie. Yeah, yeah. He'd been out of jail for like more than two years. He looked pretty red. Like, you know, not a pretty red. Yeah, I don't even let him go. He was a good mate at all. He was a good brother. So... He went over there... \nMy father, there's two my father here. One is the one and one is my brother. One is the one, eh? You call him like me? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This one, uncle, eh? He'll come home for a few days. James, I haven't met that brother. I met the other brother with the loudest him. I thought, yeah. I don't know which one he's called, but yeah. That's why we're trying to think now with Stanley. He's trying to get this thing up and running. It's going to create opportunity jobs, you know? More jobs than people. More jobs than people to get back on country. That's what it's about. Yeah. Getting back to country and... And when they have a meeting, get involved. Come along to the meeting. Yeah. Get involved. Don't just sit back with them. Yeah, boys, your opinion, eh? We really need them sort of wrong with us like that. Never know you might have some good ideas there that's never been tried before. And the only way you can get that at is by getting involved. But this is the sort of action that you put in to make that change. To change your attitude. Yeah. To change your behavior. Doing these type of things can have that effect on you. You know? This is so that you don't end up back in front of the magistrate or back in jail. These are things you put into action to make that change in your life. You know? And going about your everyday living by... You'll find that purpose to get up in the morning, eh? You know? By getting involved, you'll have that purpose. Yeah. Because no one... No one's gonna give you that... No one's gonna do it for you. You have to do it for yourself. That means motivating yourself to do it. You know? And doing a simple thing like... Even if you have your own hobby, if you like doing something, have a hobby. Go out... Get up in the morning and go and do that. Simple... Simple things, you know? Grab a lawnmower, grab a whipperslipper, do something. Just to motivate yourself today to get something, to do something, to make you feel good about yourself. It's about keeping your mind active, eh? It's about keeping your mind active. Keep your mind out and your body. Save your drifting. Mind and body, you know? Keep that active. You know? \n\nBut that is something we can work on as an individual. And don't rely on other people to do it for you. You know? Go ahead, grab a spear. Go ahead, hunt. Oh, yesterday wouldn't have been a good day for going out there for a spear. We were deadly out there yesterday. Probably today too. But motivate yourself. Put it into action to make those changes. Getting involved in community things like the men's group or any function they have down there. And offer your help. You know? Keep yourself busy. Find a purpose to get up in the morning. To get out of bed in the morning. To make you feel good about yourself. You know? You know? You know? You know, I've done a little, like them, I've done a cross and a paint. Yeah. That look great. Yeah. That look great. Super, I think, a carpet. Yeah. What are you name? And then, you painted it. Yeah. The art that I cross and I paint. Yeah, that look beautiful. I super, I think he carpet, put his name. You painted it? Yeah, and then, at the back, I put like, he teamed like Broncos or that, you know. Broncos and skip that. It's same colour, it's the same colour. And I've done it real good, you know. I do things like that, bring things back in the community, you know. Yeah, just like, and by doing that sort of thing, make you feel good about yourself. Yeah, yeah. You know, there's talent there that you might have that none of us have here. Yeah, yeah. You know, and it's up to us to bring out that talent. Yeah. And start putting it into practice. But the main discussion today was about purpose. Find that purpose and get out of bed in the morning. And in the long run, it'll help you. It'll change your attitude, change your behaviour. You know. That's what, that's what happens, and sometimes we just don't realise it until someone pointed out to us. But doing something that makes you feel good about yourself will benefit you in the long run. You know, so you don't end up back in court and back in jail. You know. And your kids will benefit. The community will benefit, you know. And that's just by finding that purpose for yourself on a daily basis. Yeah. We're gonna sign off. We're gonna put our name in. We're gonna put our name in. We're gonna put our name in. We're gonna put our name in. We're gonna put our name in. We're gonna put our name in. We're gonna put our name in. \n"

        "Are we going to talk specifically about the building? Anything we can do wherever it takes us. We're keen to learn. Alice? So we're having a bathroom and Gary. Ben. Ben. Yeah. Jane. Jane. Sakia. Sakia. I call him the boiler. Talitha. Alright. Are you documenting the block? Yeah, just I think Pika really interested in what happens after an event like that and how it felt. And then what's the documentation you can have to show everyone what the stories were from that event. Yeah. Well, it impinged on the playgroup. It ended the Sims for like 2 or 3 weeks. It still is actually. What was like the... Was everyone here? That's the first question I guess. No, it was just Jane and myself and Char. Really? What was it like when it was happening? Like did you feel like this was a big event or were you not sure? How did it feel for you? It was so scary coming down to a building and... Because I was one of the cleaners. Going in and seeing all this water and then walking in and then to go get some help and say I have to get the sweeping down, my finger out. It was terrible. And then you had the water coming down the line with the switches up. Yep. And then all the printer, all the electrical ports had water all over them. Wow. Like desks all sucked up in the water and... Yeah. Mould. Mould, yes. What was like the overall effect for the people that were supposed to use the centre? Like do you think that impacted them in terms of not being able to use it or how to go about that? Yeah, it impacted their game. Yep. At the same time. They were on track coming in every day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then that happened. We just felt sad to let them know, you know the story that was happening in the people. It interrupted their routine. Yeah. Yeah. Still. We're in the interrogation room with no windows. True. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just work. We've made it work. Yep. Yep. Done all the stuff. Made, you know, work as much as possible but just not ideal. Yep. At the same time, Loyla was working at daycare and they were cluttered out. So there wasn't this new, there's no early childhood service right now apart from our living room. Wow. They're still not open. They're still not open at all. What was the name of the daycare? Who did it go? Who did it go? Who did it go? Mary McCullough. Because you had another door. Yeah, it was another door. Because I was casual there, I would put the full time workers on. Mm-hmm.

There's also couldn't even do mobile play group for a long time because there's so many great, like so many people who have had to leave the medical centre. There's so many cases of that meliidosis from the soil. So, and that was what killed a lot of people, quite a few in towns, which are people in town. Like quite a lot of people actually end up dying from it. So you can't even take the kids out to play in the dirt or go outside. It's sort of stuck. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

        "# Ethel and Iris Ferdies\n\n[00:00:00] \n\n**Speaker 14:** She went from Air Place to there. Took the long to talk us now. \n\n**Speaker 15:** Okay. How we feeling? Alright. Pretty good. All right. The first most important part is we just need to do your full name and spell it for me so I get that right. So you wanna go this side first. Your full name and spell your name. \n\n**Speaker 16:** My full name is Etal.\n\nTaylor, T-A-Y-L-O-R, Roberton, R-O-B-E-R-T-S-O-N. \n\n**Speaker 15:** Cool. And how you spell Ethel? \n\n**Speaker 16:** E-T-H-E-L. \n\n**Speaker 15:** Awesome. And \n\n**Speaker 14:** um, my name's Aris White, IRIS. My second name is May, M-A-Y-W-H-I-T-E-Y. \n\n**Speaker 15:** Awesome. Tell me a little bit about. Um, maybe we'll start, [00:01:00] oh, we'll start with, um, \n\n**Speaker 16:** Ethel, \n\n**Speaker 15:** I'll start with Ethel. Yeah. Tell me a little bit about how you identify yourself, how you talk about yourself, introduce yourself for us.\n\n**Speaker 16:** Um, I come from a big family of 17, so our sister is my sister. Mm-hmm. So, um, yeah, our mother was one of the stolen generation at Centia. Yeah, even my father, he's born Halifax. What got taken away from there to come over and work when they were young fellas, you know, at the time can cut and all that. So, um, that's how we lived most of our life on farm.\n\nWent to school here and a case man with the airport is, and um, yeah, it was hard struggle for her mother. Like raising 17 of us. And then, [00:02:00] and um, then she ended up with only 14 because we lost two, two brothers and one sister then, yeah. But it was our struggle. But the, the older sisters, like Aris and the other sister that passed on, they had to help my mom too, see, like, to grow us up and like cook clean the house and everything.\n\nBut\n\nyou can just imagine the, um, the hardship that we had to go through. You know, we weren't allowed to play with any other kids, come home from school case men and do our chores. We all had our own chores to do. And, uh, yeah, she, she was a deadly cook. Our mother, she, she was one of the durable tribe. Yeah, she was born Berton.\n\nBut got taken away from her, her mother, [00:03:00] and her grandmother, and got, he was say like, dragged down this way. Mm-hmm. You know, grab 'em, just, you come and, you know, getting sent to Palm, whether you like it or not. Those times where went good. So I just sit down with her and I'll leave, I'll leave a lot of things from her by listening to her late at night.\n\nThey were going around the bays, like around the points, fishing and sitting. And I make you tell the stories to us. So I said, I need to learn from you so I can teach my children when I, when they grow up, you know, like when I have children and that, so this story carries on. Mm-hmm. Which you don't want it forgotten, you know what I mean?\n\nAnd it's no good bringing your children to the wheel, that they're gonna know who they're connected to and all that. Because somebody might say to who you connected to, who's your family? What language do you speak to? They say, we weren't told that. You know, so special that we keep [00:04:00] this thing going.\n\nMm-hmm. So, so Harris might wanna say some other things too. See Harris, \n\n**Speaker 14:** um, like mom, you know, she took us camping every Friday afternoon. We'd stay around the bay and. Yeah. That's the only time she could speak their language. They weren't allowed to speak their language. Mm-hmm. Being under the act, you know, you get locked up.\n\nThe, even your own community police, they, they'd go and take you to the superintendent and say, oh, so and so was talking language to their children, you know? Yeah. Um, that's how we were brought up and. Mum taught us how to cook and clean. That was our job. We had to do the washing and the washing and boiling the clothes and the [00:05:00] old copper boiler.\n\nWe had these, uh, broom handles, you know, they used to lift our clothes and take it and rinse it under the tap and hang all the. Yeah, everybody's clothes. We went through the whole house, you know, the family. So, um, then we went la uh, I wanted to go to college, but we only were, I, I only went to grade four and I was sent straight down to the hospital.\n\nDidn't have no training about nursing. My job is just to go and bath the little babies, you know, in the outta the cot. And my job was to, some of the kids had hook worms those days, and I, my job was to take the worms out of the, the napkins and put it in the bottle to show [00:06:00] the doctor in the mornings, you know?\n\nAnd then I quit because the matron, she was. She kept picking on me and so I, I went home. I walked home and um, my mom said, oh, what are you doing home? Ain't she supposed to be working? I said, no, the matron was sort of picking on me all the time, so I told her I don't wanna work down the hospital. So my mom said, oh, well you, what you gonna do?\n\nYou know, I said. Oh, I like to go work on the station. So she went and seen Mr. And I got sent out to the station. I didn't last on the first one. I got home sick and I, I ran away and came back to Palm Island and so they put me in the dormitory. I. I stayed in the dormitory for a while and then [00:07:00] went out again to work.\n\nSo I said I hated the dormitory life because I thought I'd get locked up. I didn't like, did, did. I used to look at the girls going to jail, you know, and I said, oh no, I wouldn't want to go to jail. I was trying to dodge that and I some, I got sent out again to the station. And Mr. Baram said, if you go out, if you do over 12 months, you can put in for your exemption.\n\nYou know, get out of the act. So I made up my mind. I stayed out there and got my exemption, got out the act, got married then, um, I. I moved around from other stations with my husband. I went to Blue Range and Mound, full stop. I worked there, stayed there, and [00:08:00] then we sort of split up then, and I came back to Palm to look after my mom.\n\nYou know, I, you know, she was getting sick then at that time. So I stayed and looked after my mom and I bought my three children over. Well, I picked up at another partner, but only was a drunkies used to bash me around and that, so I left him and came back to park. He brought my kids here and they went to school here, sent 'em out to college.\n\nAnd I started work at the school. Then I got a job cleaning job. I cleaned at state school for 13 years. Then I left that job and I put in [00:09:00] for cleaning job. There was a cleaning job going at the police station. I worked there 13 years. Then I retired at the age of 75. On the day I 10 to 75, I retired. And this is, I'm enjoying my retirement now, ever since then.\n\n**Speaker 15:** What's, um, what does this word elder mean to you? Both. What's that mean in to yourself? That word elder and being called an elder community, \n\n**Speaker 16:** I think more or less, you know, more than more. Then that, that, \n\n**Speaker 14:** oh, history of past, \n\n**Speaker 16:** yeah, \n\n**Speaker 14:** like that history and all that. Then it was passed down, passed, passed down. Like from our parents, parents, parents and all that.\n\nYou know? And we, you know, we, we know a lot of things that went [00:10:00] on, you know, what happened in the, in our mother's time. They handed it down to us, told us what it was like when they were growing up beyond Palm Island. Do you think the \n\n**Speaker 15:** idea of elder, the word elders changed over the last 50 a hundred years?\n\nDo you think in community, or has it, is it the same? Does it mean the same thing now as it did a long time ago, or has it changed, do you think? \n\n**Speaker 14:** I think it's sort of changed, you know, like. S you don't hear much about elders, you know, in some communities you see some communities, you know, they show their elders, you know, some places you don't hardly see them.\n\nYou know, probably some of them had, you know, died out. You know, like he and a lot [00:11:00] of our elders, there's only a few, you know, just coming up. Hmm. Now, you know, we hope that they take our place, you know? \n\n**Speaker 16:** Yeah. Because, because we're the 1940 babies. \n\n**Speaker 14:** Yeah. \n\n**Speaker 16:** You \n\n**Speaker 14:** know \n\n**Speaker 16:** what I mean? And we seen this place grow. Yeah. I mean, and now, oh, cemetery, that's another cemetery out in the front here.\n\nMm-hmm. You know, even where they play football, that's the cemetery. Mm-hmm. My partner's grandmother's buried there, you know. She was named Minnie Ross. They were buried there and dad and his dad's mother and father, they buried across Francis' Creek. See is all still all graves. \n\n**Speaker 17:** Yeah. See, \n\n**Speaker 16:** lot of the young generation still don't know that.\n\nThey don't know. And I used to go down to the 70 when I was about five or six. His dad, my dad used to work on the down at the cemetery here and I used to get all these little, [00:12:00] used to call 'em cocky apple, but I used to turn 'em into little pigs. And I used to make a day with pigs, you know, imagination. See, that time we weren't glad to go to school till we was about six.\n\nYou know, you couldn't just ten five 'em go to school. That's when we came under the act. But, uh, see a lot of the young people still don't know the stories. So I was teaching a lot of people about that, like gener generation, they didn't even know about that. Then, um, when I was managing the pub back in the eighties.\n\nThe kids used to come down and like grownups, they used to ask me the stories. So when I finished work and so exhausted that I go, I just wanted to have a feed and have a shower and go to sleep. But I used to find the rounds back with young people because they wanted to come into the stories 'cause they weren't told that.\n\nSo most of them are down here too. There's only a few that that I told [00:13:00] stories to that is left. Mostly them passed away from alcohol, drugs or commit suicide. Sad. You know what I mean? Mm-hmm. Because they never lived their life that we lived. You know? It's sad to see 'em from a baby and they're gone. Yeah.\n\n**Speaker 14:** Some of them so used to lived on the. Social, you know, never went out to work. Yeah. We had to work on the stations, all that place, you know, uh, they what hard work they so used to being on Centrelink payment. Yeah. And young girls, you know, they go to college, they come back, get pregnant, three or four kids and you know, the man dump 'em for someone else and they left to carry, you know.\n\nTo grow their \n\n**Speaker 17:** children \n\n**Speaker 14:** up, grow the kids up, then they turn to drugs and [00:14:00] alcohol. It's sad. There's a lot of it going on here, you know? Now with the ice, the ice is getting bad. It's sad, you know? You know, a lot of our young kids are on it and very few kids go to school, you know, \n\n**Speaker 16:** and it was good with our old people because.\n\nYou know, there was no things like alcohol unless they smuggle it. Uh, I know my dad was one, they up in the mountain here and they used to get this palm tree. You see it? And when they strip it, it's all white and they chop it up, chop it up, chop it up, and they boil it. That's wine. Mm. And you can smell it, but it gotta sit for so many months or something.\n\nTwo or three months before, what do they call it? The [00:15:00] No, how it, um, oh, what would they say? You know, like, like they boil it and boil it and then they. Preserve that. The part that they boiled, they're gonna let us sit for about two or three months, but it can be covered over. Oh yeah. Yeah. So when it's maybe two or three months after it's covered over, then they can take it and they can drink it and they get drunk.\n\nEven the plump, the be can plump the red. They make their wine from that. See, a lot of these young people don't even know that. Yeah. So I'm not gonna tell 'em that story. That's \n\n**Speaker 14:** bad enough \n\n**Speaker 16:** nowadays. Yeah. Keep on they their way. It's so strictly that young people would put you in, you know? So if I walk down the beach here tonight and I sneaking around and this young fellow to come and meet me, [00:16:00] I would've got caught because the pimp would go and tell the police.\n\nMm. See those times. So, I dunno why they're doing it because they got nothing out of it. Mm.

Yeah. And yeah. Right. Yeah. And you know, those days they used to pick all the half cast kid to go to college. Yeah. Yeah, and I used to cry and I used to say to the sister, [00:19:00] mother Zita, I said, I like to go to college. Can I go? And she said, oh no, only this was wrong, only the fair ones.\n\nLike my cousin, she was picked and I said, oh, I'd love to go to college. They used to send 'em out to charter staffs.

I said, oh, I hate this job. I said, I'm gonna ask, can I leave this place? I'm gonna go out in the station. I love the station life. I really loved. \n\n**Speaker 15:** What station were you at? \n\n**Speaker 14:** I was on Glencoe outside of Charter Stairs.\n\nThe first station I went at, Stan broke. That was the end of the line before you get to Dejara. And I went out there and those people, they were terrible. They, I went. And there was a Palm Island lady, uh, Erin and her husband, they was working there. Mr. Baram said, oh, you'll be right. S and Alan Gibson working out there.\n\nSo I went out and I was all right at night. You know, we [00:21:00] used to carry the trays over with the food for, to, to the mistress and that, and there was an orange tree right on the footpath, right. And I was looking at the orange and I said, oh gee, that was orange. Look big. So I took one orange that night and the boss and the his Mrs.\n\nCame over and my, that lady said to me, Sybil said, yeah, you didn't take any orange off the tree. And I said, why? She said, you know that old bookie, he counts the oranges? I said, what? I said, can't be. I said, how he know one orange is missing? Oh, he knows. He used to sweep under the tree, and I took one orange and I was peeling it, and I, I threw the skin down the bank of the river in the long grass.\n\nAnd, oh, Mrs. Simpson come now, she said, she said, what can I see at [00:22:00] your room? I said, what for? Said, did you, you you stole one orange? And I said, no, I, I said, no, I didn't. Yes. I said, you can see it in my room. She was looking around in the room for the orange skin, but she didn't go down the bank of the river.\n\nI threw all the skin down there. She said, I told you. I said, why? I said, these oranges falling down in their yard. She said, they won't let anybody touch it. I said, what? The birds are knocking them and they're eating them. I said, oh, staff this. I said, I'm, I'm taken off. I said, I'm gonna run away. I am going back to Palm Island.\n\nMm. I jumped on, I was supposed to go for a dentist. I it in the toilet, in the train, in Lander and it there. Every time I looked there was a police. The police was there waiting to take me off the train. \n\n**Speaker 17:** Mm. \n\n**Speaker 14:** They looked, but I was in the toilet. I went right through to [00:23:00] Townsville. I got off there. I got away.\n\nI just, I was one step ahead of the police. When I jumped on the boat, the police car just pulled up there. I was already on the boat. The boat was li and then I got here. Mr. Said, oh, you ran away. Hey, I, I said, yeah, because the, the bosses weren't good. I said, they wouldn't even share the fruit. Yeah. They just said, oh, you can't touch the fruit.\n\nI said, well, why grow them? I said, oh no. I said, I'm not staying here. I used to cry every night when the sun go down. Wow. Yeah. I got homesick there. I didn't like that place. Yeah. But then I went out to Glen Co. I went to Blue Rain. They were lovely people. We sat at the same table. But them days up in [00:24:00] Cloncurry, when I went there for the dentist, I slept at the police station.\n\nThey put me on a old bed with a brick under it, and they put me under the slam post. They told Mr. Simpson that I could stay at the motel. She said, oh, you'll be staying in the motel. And when I, when the police picked me up and I said, am I going to the motel? No, you staying at the. The police barracks. So I went there and he said, you, you see that bed there?\n\nHe said, you sleep under the lamppost. That light was on me and the cat was ju crawling all over me. I was slinging the cat. And the next day I, when I got my tea down and I went and I said, can I catch the train back to the station? And he said, why? I said, because I ain't staying here. I said, getting treated like I'm a criminal.\n\nAnd when I said, uh, where can I go and have a [00:25:00] shower and have my breakfast? Oh, you'll have to go way down. You gotta walk down to the reserve. I said, oh no. I said, that's too far. He said, oh, well you can go and have a shower in that old tank there. It was an old tanks. Cut in the half, you know, he said, you gotta go and get a bucket of water out of the watch house and you can have a shower there.\n\nI said, no. I said, well, can you put me on the next train back? He said, oh, well if you want to go, you can go. I said, yeah, I, I don't wanna stay here. There were races. And he said, uh oh. When you go for your breakfast? I said, there, there was a Murray police there. He was a tracker. And he said, I said, where are we gonna sit?\n\nHe said, oh, you gotta go and sit out in the wood heap. So I had to sit out in the wood heap with my plate, and there was reporters in town that day [00:26:00] they were walking past. And I said, I felt that shame, you know, there was a, a colored woman. She murdered a, uh, a baby. She battered this baby with this bar, those big kerosene, so they used to call it.\n\nMm-hmm. She bashed that baby and she was in that watch house that night.

When, you know, you drove through Manga Avenue or the Manga tree, it's only white people could walk there.\n\nThey stopped all the Ries from walking through there. It's only now that it's, you know, we're allowed to walk through there now.\n\n**Speaker 17:** Wow. \n\n**Speaker 14:** And I always thought that Palm Island would never change, you know, thinking when I was small. Mm. But I thought there were gonna be no changes. It's gonna be like that forever. Yeah. But yeah, it very bit better than when we were kids. They like the young generation.

      "Bio": "Ethel Robertson\nA proud daughter of the Stolen Generations and one of 17 siblings, Ethel carries her mother’s strength and the stories of survival. From being raised under harsh restrictions to running the Palm Island pub in the 1980s, she has lived through eras of control and resistance. Today, she is a knowledge-keeper, storyteller, and cultural custodian dedicated to passing on truth to the next generations.\n\nIris White\nA resilient matriarch and sharp storyteller, Iris worked across hospitals, schools, and police stations for decades. Her early life was shaped by unjust rules and dormitory systems, but she found her voice through nursing, station life, and raising her children through hardship. Now retired, she reflects on the shifting meaning of “Elder” and the importance of keeping cultural memory alive in a world that often forgets."

        "Put it down here. Oh, . You're hungry, Ben. No, I had something just not long ago. Thank you. \n\nI'm just introducing Ben here. I want to . And you want to . \n\nSo if you want to go in and . I'm . I'm . I'm . I'm . I'm . Who called ? I'm part of this group. . Oh, Ethel. Hey, Ethel. Hi. Hey, Oz. I think I'm . Ben. I'm Frank. Hey, Frank. Ben. I'm here. You're not . We met . Elsa. Elsa. Oh, . And who's this father? Mm-hmm . Thanks so much for having me. It's awesome that you made the effort to come and see me. I've been yarning with Rachel Atkinson for a little bit about what is stories from Palmyl. And I travel around Australia very luckily and get to tell stories around lots of places. So especially Calcadun country, I get to spend lots of time there. Mount Isa. Mbappua, Alice Springs there. And a bit further north up Tennant Creek for the area. And then spend a lot of time on Ranger Basque, Dreadbroke Island, hanging out with the Elders Justice Group there. So yeah, and I used to travel around, you know, Orange Sky? Yeah. So I used to work there a while ago and I used to travel around Australia and tell stories with people who use the band. Oh, that's good. So yeah, Rachel asked if I could come over and the main focus is just having an understanding about what it was like when that recent storm hit the island and what was the effect on the community and just like really look at just like what's the story that comes out of that. Because I think it's probably a small part of a much broader project of telling stories about what's happening on Palm Island. And like I've been here four days now, just sort of hanging around different places, you know, with people. And I think the thing I start to realise is there's a lot happening here and there's a lot of activity and there's a lot of stories that I'd love to help show the rest of Australia what happens here and more of the nuanced stuff. Like it's not just about like a couple of nice photos or like a couple of people. I think it's everything. So today, yeah, today I just wanted to have a yarn about how the storm affected you yourself. But then also just anything else I think that you think is important to talk about. So we're going to make something. Maybe it looks like a book or some type of magazine or some type of reflection. Yeah. There will be photos and reflections and news articles and stuff in there. And then I was going to try and work with some of the young people and think about what's something that we could maybe build or do together as a memory type thing as well. Maybe we could do a little like joint, like young people, elders type project. Yeah. Who wants to start? What storms? What storms? The recent one that had the blackout and some of the landslides and stuff. The big monosone will come. Can we do? The big monosone will come. Can we do? I do. Do you think it's well with the area or . What storms? The recent one that had the blackout and some of the landslides. The big monster will come. Oh. And . \n\nInto Ralphie's yard. Where was this? The big monster ran here. January. February. You know the big, all the rain come. And it was here for a couple of months. A month or so. The poor damn rain. You know what happened to your place and what happened to your yard. You get flooded out there and there. A little rain. The breeze is out of the ground. Yeah, yeah. You had blackouts. No electricity. No. No. You was all right then. I know. You're in the same area. When was this? January. January. Beginning of the year. Beginning of the year. The rain came down. It was all covered in Queensland. All the rain. Do you remember? Do you remember? I was stopped up near the creek in the kitchen of life. So what happened in my office? I got the rain pump. I had three palms clean on the house. So I had to get them removed. Water came through the roof into my first bedroom. It's just called clothes and stuff. Into my lighting. I'm still getting lighting and everything fixed as we speak. I just had the fans to be done. Switches to smoke. Water's in the electricity power. Quite wet up there. I'm writing that there are three things. I heard a few things. My clothesline is not thin. I'm still waiting for repairs. I've got some pieces to go through. We lost out on clothes, food. And those electricity things started happening. Life by life just went out and walked into the roof. They had to repair the roof. They haven't done it properly yet. I feel a way worse. What was the... Did people know what was going on? Could you... Did people know what was going on? Could you... Did people know what was going on? Could you... Did people know what was going on? Could you... Like, were there ways in which that people community was communicating with you? Because that's true. We just sort of... We just sort of... We just sort of... We're not... We're not... We're not... We're not... We're not... But my place... I'll be lost... A couple of days or something. But this is what we've got to generate it. We use that for our preaching and everything like that. Even though some stuff we'd go off from. As long as they're about to eat it. But... Yeah, my yard is in front. Because... I live like... I'm in a slope. And I'm at the airport into my backyard. And water just comes through. Off the roads and that. Just comes in and... And it's in front of my... Front around it. Should've got a standing on my driveway. And as long as it gets washed away... Because it's in your... And it's like you've got black mud and... But my backyard is all front. And it's like... And that's like... Yeah, we were... We were all right. With... With a generator. Yeah, I mean that's what a lot of people should... Invest in. Generator for their... Especially with Paradise for a couple of days or so. And that's so... Yeah, so... Yeah, so... And we couldn't move anywhere. Because... Too much rain. I think... I saw it was stressing because it was on my own up there too. And it was on my own up there too. And the palm trees would've been higher than the house. And I think it was earlier as a Sunday morning. And I just heard a problem. And I was thinking... What's going on? It was Sunday morning. I realised... Excuse me. It was sick in my room. So lucky they didn't crash. I was gonna come right through my front room. And that caused me a bit of stress. Because I was on my own. I lost the washing machine. I lost the fridge as well. I was sitting in my brain there. Um... There's no things that happened with that. So... It did cause stress. I think the big factor too was... For palm was... Cause... Um... Transportation, you know. There's floods. Food. Food. Food. We didn't have the barge. The barge. All the things coming. Yeah. I think that was the biggest factor for us. More than a week was going to wait for the flooders here. And we had to get... Um... We had to rely on... The planes had been stopping it over. But then the planes stopped. Yeah. Yeah. The planes stopped. The air was too much. And heavy air. So... Um... Yeah. So... It was even being flooded from both sides. Yeah. From... Yeah. From... Yeah. Nothing could get through. And we said... Um... Oh, a big bridge was washed out. Yeah. You know. It was a big bridge. It was a big bridge. And... It was a big bridge. And... That's the thing is though. We had to rely on... The planes had been stopping it over. And then the planes stopped. Yeah. Because it ran too much. And heavy air. Um... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because... There was a land slide there. Yeah. Yeah. And that so... That took that pole. And Caroline took it down. And that and that, but yeah, so... Yeah, we were happy. It was the back to that one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. What is it? I don't know. I think people are just getting frustrated. You know, we have limited resources. Yeah. It's just not fun, especially those little children too, you know? Yeah. I mean, us, we probably can't survive. And it didn't start to stress out. It started to get to everybody. The council had been supervising water and food, you know? Yeah. They took that, that was a little bit of a problem. They took that, that was a little bit of milk off. Milk, water. Water. Water. Water. Water. Water. And there was the big bottles, you know, the little bottles. Yeah. I was lucky to go around to the basketball court when they had one more stuff. And Denise missed that. But now, what's her name? Darwin's been took the water. Yeah. To our thing and stuff. That was a thing. Supplied lot of water bottles and things are quite a hard thing to do. These households, you know, and they're quite the way everywhere on time. And so, it was really good. The water, then, they probably, started to taste, or something. Yeah. And there's some pots and that and things and that. Yeah. So that's what happened when the, the, the planes came in, when it was there. So that subsided. Sorry. Good afternoon. Come on. Come on. Thank you. Goodness. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Key. Oh no. Someone got to get him with the key. And was there things that you think could need to get better for that type? If there's another one. Do you think there's things that you learnt or found out that needs to change? To get better prepared? No. We'll be all right here with it. That doesn't necessarily front. We'll be all going to the ocean. Yeah. But just on the mainland area, we're surprised. Not coming. Yeah. That's why then they had, they moved from, Ingham, we said that, they had to cancel the middle of South Park, the Vod itself. Yeah. So, there was another people who came out, they went to the council, and then came to come with the prize and things. So, it was good. They worked closely with the council, and people know them too, you know, so, who, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Most of the people, some I know, that, we were standing on water. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It didn't come down to that area. Yeah, I didn't really. You didn't get any. Yeah. Yeah. It was, that water was flooded there too. It was flooded. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was, yeah. It's really. I don't know. Even the road is very nice. Yeah. Yeah. It's just flooded. Yeah. That's why it's totally done. But when you're up on the air, what? What are you on the air? No, it's not. No, it's not. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's ridiculous. Because that's the only straw. But the price you need to pay, aren't you? Mm. That's not what I like. Mm. You can go in there with $100 and what'd you get? One bag. Mm. Probably five items. Mm. Yeah, they do. Do you know who runs the barge? Who are you? Palm Island. I don't know who. Council or? Council or Lucinda? No. Lucinda. Lucinda. It's Lucinda, isn't it? Oh, yeah. It's Lucinda. It's Lucinda. It's Lucinda. We're not quite sure what the arrangements are between the guys. Yeah. We're not quite sure what the arrangements are between the council and the barge. Yeah. It's cool it's in the barge, but they don't come on when they bring it up. Oh. So we're not sure what that arrangements are. Is that Alana Barge? Yeah. We don't know, actually. So, that, Karen? What about the money? That, I was it? Is that Karen? Yeah, back there when it comes to the other one. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Christmas, I've been already, um, we don't know what we want. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. If you've got hospital staff here, like Mulline Farm. Mm. Mm. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Can I ask you some for the staff? You Jasper, do for the helpings? . When you have the storms too, if you've got hospital staff here like one of the pharmacies with medication, that does affect people to go and get medication too, you know, because they can't get back on the island, that's another risk back to that one. They should have a back up person. Yeah, or train someone up. And what's the difference between the health centre and the hospital? Is that two different types of service? The health system is for the community. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And can I ask what, like, what's the... as elders, what's the sort of role when it comes to that type of thing? Is it a voice as a part of this or what's the... What do you think your role is in as an emergency or... That's a good question. Mm-hmm. Because I think we should have a role there too. Yeah. Yeah. And I think we should have a role there too. Yeah. And then we should have a medical centre. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And can I ask what, like, what's the... what's the... as elders, what's the sort of role when it comes to that type of thing? Is it a... do you have a voice as a part of this or what's the... what do you think your role is in when there's emergencies or...? That's a good question. Mm-hmm. Because I think we should have a role there too in some areas. But I feel that we don't get invited, eh? No. We don't... They don't include any of the elders community to any of those type of things. Yeah. They have engagement dates or... or... in certain days. You can go into it, you cannot say anything. That's a problem. Yeah. Yeah. You... If you've got something to say, you can't say it. So they'll talk to you right there then. And... Yeah. But they're not doing that... They're not doing that. They're not doing that. Oh, yeah. Well, engagement rates, both of the people who... get the ideas of what they're on about. Yeah. But... They're gonna say, you go and they sit down, you can't open your mouth up for what they say. You might reject what they say. And they don't want that, see? They will step them in the face of things. And so you're gonna sit there and it's quite a little bit. You cannot go into the open, oh, you gotta do something like this now. There's a lot of people that's very wrong about certain things that's happening with them. So, you know, I'm saying, well, boys have an engagement date when you can't speak your mind on the day. Is that here on... Engagement day. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know that woman's in the right? I think so. But they have a... Yeah. Yeah. You know that woman down the road? I think so. But they have it in the... They have it in the... In the... In the... In the... In the community. Yeah. In the little everywhere, you know, eh? You gotta put your name down... Yeah. You gotta put your name down to a town. Yeah. You gotta put your name down to a town. What? Yeah. You gotta put your name down to a town. You gotta put your name down. Well, I mean, you know when they had the governor here, we didn't know nothing. Really? I was invited and then... Rosina was. And all of a sudden, she had to give the gift. And she jumped. Cause she didn't even know... And she wasn't told. It was unexpected. She had to give the gift to the governor. And then they'll be turned and looked straight across. Oh, before we think... I said, no, you can bless the food. I said, yeah. We're on the spot. We didn't know nothing. So I had no choice, see? Yeah. There you are. There you are. There you are. There you are. There you are. There you are. There you are. So I had no choice, see? Yeah. There you are. There's a last note that they come to me. Yeah. For the elders to attend. That day I was sitting there. That day I was sitting there. I was sitting there. I couldn't do it. Yeah, she gave us some of their, yeah. Yeah, but there's a thing about it. And now they've got certain high profile people coming over you. In violence, you know? In violence, yeah. But I was sleeping for the day before. Exactly. See, that's what they did to me. Yeah? Late in the afternoon. When you run around like that. I run around like that. I took his head to the top of the ground. But that's the thing. Tuesday I was sick when that governor came out. I was very sick. I couldn't move anymore. Yeah, I didn't go. Yeah, so that's the thing. I said, well, next Sunday, I emailed Tanya and all them. I said, you need to give me a couple of weeks. I was thinking about what happened. Then I would explain to the elders maybe what's going to be happening. Yeah. And then I'd communicate that way. I think, oh, yeah. Send their name out. She'll attend tomorrow with the elders. It doesn't work that way with me. I didn't work that way with me. But then they were like, oh, yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I didn't know. I'm sorry. Yeah, I didn't know. I didn't know. I didn't know. I didn't know. I didn't know. I didn't know. Yeah. I didn't know. I didn't know. I didn't know. I didn't know. I didn't know. I just thought that way with me. One day, another day, the afternoon. And I'll ask. And it's not fair, you know. It isn't fair. It isn't fair. Yeah. What's, I've been thinking a bit about voices and knowledge and stuff, how it gets passed on. Do you think there's much of your voice available anywhere? Like across plans or archives or that type of thing? Like, does anyone ever come and do interviews with you and record your knowledge and stuff? I reckon they should be done because they can tell us. You know, they do a lot to tell. They've got a lot to tell. They're in the 80s. I'm via do最近. She's 16. She's a man with this lady, yeah. Oh, that's what I have since the before. In… No, I'm not going to ask. They should be recorded. They should be heard. Give me a story. Because it helps. It helps. And then on, you know. When I put that question to the council report, just a few years back, and I asked, I walked in here, and asked, one of those all sitting right in the table, and he said, excuse me. He said, why can't we have a public meeting? They looked at me in the room and they said, and it took a while before they came. Somebody had been talking and saying something to me. He said, no, we can't have any public meeting. And I said, well, I'd like to know why. And I said, playing those games. It's a rivalry. I said, come straight forward. And those were my own. And I said, no, we have our meeting. We are told to us, that's not right. Because the people are going to have any public meeting for the people. Because they'll start a riot. And I said, what do you mean a riot? They're going to start a big argument and police them and get involved and all this. But like I said, it was all gammon, gammon, you know? They said, no, we'd rather we have our meeting. We are told to us, that's not right. Because the people need to know what's going on. That's it. I told you she had something there to back me up. But I thought I was going to be in the middle of that Monroe that went straight into the water bottle. You know what I mean? Yeah, you know, I just asked that. Yeah, no. I mean, you understand they're saying this was right in 2004. But come on, you know, don't block our communities. There's no one out here knows what's going on. Well, that's true. And yet there's talk about the traditional owners don't give their information over the community, but they won't share that same information with them as well. I mean, it is true. They don't. You know? Yeah. And I think that public community... No. And I think that's what they're afraid of. Trying to don't stand that right. But community has a lot of rights to know what's going on and what their decisions are surrounding trustees. It has to be... I think the way they can have a public meeting up there, because that's covered. And so on. But why don't they do it? I don't know. I don't know. You can't have them in the public area now, like in the mall. And these and the... Oh, we know they're saving it. Yeah, I know. They're all there, yeah. But the thing is, you cannot have it in the mall in the area. But still, if you can't even... That's covered by the police. But they're probably thinking, you know, people are going to go walk and... Yeah. You know? Voice their opinion on that. But that's just... But that's got to be done, eh? That's just natural. It's got to be aired, eh? That's right. It's got to be aired. You always will get a reaction. Yeah, of course. Yeah, of course. That's anyway. It's got to be aired. It's got to be aired. It's got to be aired. It's got to be aired. It's got to be aired. It's got to be aired. It's got to be aired. It's got to be aired. It's got to be aired. Are you talking about 30? Yeah. 30, yeah. Yeah. That was built for alcohol and drugs. Yeah, I actually used to come to 30 13 years ago with cranked services, run programs. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I used to love being there. I used to work at 30s. I was there for a number of years. Yeah. And then I lived for mental health and AIR. So I've been up there now. Yeah, I'm very interested in... And I think it should all come back again. Yeah, definitely. But then I'd have a residential aid. And I'm putting up residential stuff. There's some really good models around the world where if you have a place in community where people can recover, it's a really positive opportunity as long as people are looked after there. But yeah, I love 30s for some reason. I've got a very strong appearance. Yeah, I love it. I love the times. You feel it. You know, things that you do. It's good times. You feel it. You're all just a week there. Yeah. And I just work with the prison too, see? Yeah. Bring more back there, more. Yep. You know, bring them back in, you know, into Columbia. And it was good. I was there one of them. Young weeks there. You wasn't there with the film. Oh, right. Take another one. No, I wasn't there. We were as old as you. Oh, were you? Yeah. Yeah, right. We were made from film. Oh, I'd love to say it. Yeah. You're old. Where are they? I'll get a beer, right? I'll get a beer, right? I'll get a beer. I'll get a beer, right? I am. You got one. I know what happened to mine. The cuckoo and them were sitting on the car. Yeah. Yeah. You got one. I think that they had one. And they bestowed with mine. Everyone got one. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. I got two. The school. The school. Yeah. For instance. If people have rehab here, and some people come for help, especially if you transition them to come for community, come back for help. Yeah. Thank you, you know. You don't have some place to go. The land or people handle help you with just mental health is shitting them out. Owen Yama, Ormanton, they want to send them away or walk them up over here. It's wrong. They need somewhere for the alcohol or the drug addict. There's no crimes that they are drug-related. They're serious crimes and a lot of them are looking to come back to the community but they can't do it because they don't know where to go. Especially if you can match the cultural knowledge with professional knowledge. Knowledge to make sure they're healthy but then knowledge to make sure they're psychologically. One question I did have was a lot of government funds. A lot of the funding, there's always a question in there. It's like, have you engaged elders? It's in every funding thing. Is that something that you get asked to do very often? No. Because I'm just fascinated because it's a question that's always in there but I've never heard of it actually happening. True. So I'm trying to work out what's actually the case. Then who answers that. Then who answers it, yeah. Then who answers it, yeah. You're wrong? Yeah. "

      "Bio": "The Elders Group on Palm are the heart of the island’s wisdom. They speak with power about the impacts of recent storms, food insecurity, and the absence of meaningful inclusion in government decision-making. They highlight how their knowledge is often overlooked despite being vital to recovery and resilience. The group advocates for stronger intergenerational partnerships, respectful consultation, and public forums where community truth can be spoken freely.\n\n"
